To discern the interrelationship of T cell differentiation and outcome of human infection, we examined factors that regulate T cell differentiation and Th1/Th2 cytokine responses in asymptomatic infection, active and historical chronic and recurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis. T-bet, GATA-3, Foxp3, and cytokine gene expression were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and correlated with interleukin 2, interferon ?, tumor necrosis factor ?, interleukin 4, interleukin 13, and interleukin 10 secretion during in vitro response to live Leishmania panamensis.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Higher GATA-3 expression than T-bet expression occurred throughout the 15 days of coculture with promastigotes; however, neither transcription nor secretion of interleukin 4 was detected. A sustained inverse correlation between GATA-3 expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interferon ? and tumor necrosis factor ? was observed in asymptomatic infection. In contrast, higher T-bet expression and a higher ratio of T-bet to GATA-3 characterized active recurrent disease. Down-regulation of T-bet and GATA-3 expression and increased interleukin 2 secretion, compared with control subjects, was directly correlated with Foxp3 expression and interleukin 13 secretion in chronic disease.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions.

In the Finnish Family HPV Study, 329 pregnant women (mean age, 25.5 years) were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy and were followed up for 6 years. Multiplex HPV genotyping for 27 low- and high-risk HPV types was used to define genotype-specific prevalence at each visit. Generalized estimating equation models were constructed to estimate predictors of type-specific persistence (positive results at 2 consecutive visits) of species 7 and 9 HPV genotypes.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. HPV16 was the most common type, followed by HPV types 18, 31, 35, 45, 58, 70, and 6. Prevalence of multiple infections ranged from 21% to 45%. Persistence was most prolonged for HPV types 35, 58, and 52, with durations of 38.7, 32.1, and 24.2 months, respectively, and was equal for multiple-type infections and HPV16, with durations of 21 and 24 months, respectively. Independent predictors of type-specific persistence of species 7 and 9 HPV genotypes were age (odds ratio, 1.13 [95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.25]; P = .017), oral sex (odds ratio, 0.37 [95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.81]; P = .013), and young age (<13 years) at initiation of smoking (odds ratio, 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.98]; P = .046).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion.

We tested 463 men, ages 18–40 years, in 2 cities in the United States for 37 HPV types in samples from 5 anogenital sites. Men answered questionnaires regarding number of partners and frequency of condom use during vaginal sex in the past 3 months (5 categories, from "always" to "never"). Among 393 men who reported ?1 female partner in the past 3 months, the proportions of men with HPV detected overall and at each anatomic site by frequency of condom use were calculated. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between frequency of condom use and HPV detection. Effect modification by number of recent partners (1 vs >1) was evaluated.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. The proportion of men positive for HPV ranged from 37.9% among men who reported they "always" used condoms to 53.9% among those who reported they "never" used condoms (P for trend = .008). Always using condoms (vs using them less frequently) was associated with lower odds of HPV detection (adjusted odds ratio, 0.50 [95% confidence interval, 0.30–0.83]).

To unravel mechanisms of infection, stock cells labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) were inoculated intravaginally.

Systemic and persistent infection was achieved after vaginal exposure of macaques to SIV-infected cells. The dose needed to infect 50% of females was 6.69 × 10? ± 2.08 × 10? viral DNA copies.
