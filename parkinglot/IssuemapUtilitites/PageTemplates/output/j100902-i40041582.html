Using summer drought and growing season temperature as defined climate drivers, we evaluated relationships between forest dynamics and climate across levels of organization.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Over the four-decade study period, forest communities underwent successional change and substantially increased in biomass. Variation in summer drought and growing season temperature contributed to temporal biomass dynamics for some tree species, but not for others. Stand-level responses to climatic variability were related to the responses of component species, except in pine stands. Pinus echinata, the dominant species in pine stands, decreased over time due to periodic outbreaks of pine bark beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis).These outbreaks at Walker Branch could not be directly related to climatic conditions.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: The results indicate that sensitivity of developing forests to climatic variability is stand type-dependent, and hence is a function of species composition. However, in the long term, direct effects of climatic variability on forest dynamics may be small relative to autogenic successional processes or climate-related insect outbreaks. Empirical studies testing for interactions between forest succession and climatic variability are needed.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40925531</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>In the boreal forest of eastern Canada, how does forest vegetation change in the sustained absence of fire?</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>In the boreal forest of eastern Canada, how does forest vegetation change in the sustained absence of fire?</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Location: Eastern boreal forest in Quebec's North Shore region, Canada (49°30'-50°00'N; 67°30'-68°35'W).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: Aerial photos from three different periods (1930, 1965 and 1987) were used to characterize changes in vegetation composition in 23 scenes of 200 ha.

Initial multi variate analysis using Principal Response Curves was used to assess if particular traits were associated with either extensive or abandoned treatments, and was checked using uni variate tests of individual traits.

Herbivore defecation and wildfire are two major ecosystem disturbances likely to alleviate effects of these allelopathic substances.

Reindeer faeces addition and burning treatments to Empetrum humus caused three- and five-fold increases in growth of the herbaceous species Avenella flexuosa and Solidago virgaurea respectively.

Tamarisk and native riparian plant species seedlings cannot establish in these dry, shaded habitats. Russian olive can rely on upper soil water until 15 years of age, before utilizing groundwater.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: We demonstrate that even though there is little evidence of facilitation by cottonwood and tamarisk, Russian olive is able to tolerate dense shade and low moisture conditions better than tamarisk and cottonwood. There is great potential for continued spread of Russian olive throughout the southwestern US because large areas of suitable habitat exist that are not yet inhabited by this species.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40925525</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Question: Can discriminant analysis be used to quantify ecological change?

The data set was filtered to exclude rare taxa from the analysis. Given that after application of the filter there were more variables (samples) than observations (taxa), the model was "de-saturated" through simulation of samples based on the existing data set.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: The inclusion of taxa that have a relative abundance of 1% or more in at least 5% of the samples reduces noise in the data set. Application of discriminant analysis to pollen data gave an error of 18% when classifying taxa by affinity with dry or wet conditions.

Total reproductive effort in the field layer vegetation increased, height decreased and cover of light-demanding species and graminoids increased with increasing moose density.The effects of moose density were modified by the productivity gradient, leading to a higher relative increase in light availability and reproductive effort in highly productive areas than in low productive areas.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Increased light availability was an important indirect effect of moose density, leading to less competition for light and a shift towards early successional species.

Ordination by partial DCA and path analysis was used to confirm: (1) the effect of wind speed and altitude ( ? temperature) on vegetation structure, i.e. canopy height and cover of bare ground, and (2) the control of arctic/alpine macrolichen occurrence by vegetation structure.

However, incorporating wind speed as an additional explanatory variable had an important modifying effect on the vegetation response to temperature: decreasing wind speed exaggerates the effects of increased temperature and vice versa.
