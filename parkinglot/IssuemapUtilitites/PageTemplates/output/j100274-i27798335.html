Among children with persistent asthma, defined as having one or more sleep disturbances due to asthma per week, 59.0% reported using a long-term control medication. After adjusting for demographic factors, children who had an asthma plan, had visited a doctor in the previous 6 months for nonurgent asthma care, or were enrolled in an asthma education program were more likely to use long-term control medication (odds ratios: 6.00, 4.11, 2.88, respectively).

These data were linked with Medicare cost reports, and supplemented with other sources, including the Area Resource File. We analyze the hazard rates of trauma center closures among several dimensions of risk factors using discrete-time proportional hazard models.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: The number of trauma center closures increased from 1990 to 2005, with a total of 339 during this period. The hazard rate of closing trauma centers in hospitals with a negative profit margin is 1.38 times higher than those hospitals without the negative profit margin (P < 0.01). Hospitals receiving more generous Medicare reimbursements face a lower hazard of shutting down trauma centers (ratio: 0.58, P < 0.01) than those receiving below average reimbursement. Hospitals in areas with higher health maintenance organizations penetration face a higher hazard of trauma center closure (ratio: 2.06, P < 0.01). Finally, hospitals in areas with higher shares of minorities face a higher risk of trauma center closure (ratio: 1.69, P < 0.01). Medicaid load and uninsured populations, however, are not risk factors for higher rates of closure after we control for other financial and community characteristics.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Our findings give an indication on how the current proposals to cut public spending could exacerbate the trauma closure particularly among areas with high shares of minorities. In addition, given the negative effect of health maintenance organizations on trauma center survival, the growth of Medicaid managed care population should be monitored. Finally, high shares of Medicaid or uninsurance by themselves are not independent risk factors for higher closure as long as financial pressures are mitigated. Targeted policy interventions and further research on the causes, are needed to address these systems-level disparities.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27798343</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Objective: To evaluate Hospital at Home (HaH), a substitute for inpatient care, from the perspectives of participating providers.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Objective: To evaluate Hospital at Home (HaH), a substitute for inpatient care, from the perspectives of participating providers.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Research Design: Multivariate general estimating equations regression analyses of a patient-specific survey of providers delivering HaH care in a prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Subjects: Eleven physicians and 26 nurses employed in 3 Medicare-Advantage plans and 1 Veterans Administration medical center.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Measures: Problems with care; benefits; problem-free index.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Case response rates were 95% and 82% for physicians and nurses, respectively.

We stratified our cohort into new and prevalent medication users and evaluated the impact of the Target label on outpatient, emergency department and inpatient health services use.

In the new-user analysis, we found no significant change in rates of both outpatient (event rate ratio: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.15–1.86) and inpatient and emergency department (Event rate ratio: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62–1.24) health services utilization in Target users after implementation when compared with non-Target users.

Immunotherapy use varied significantly by age, race, insurance status, year of diagnosis, and type of treatment facilities, with largest effects observed in years of diagnosis, followed by insurance status. Among young cancer patients, we found that compared with uninsured patients, the odds of receiving immunotherapy were 1.61, and 2.13 for privately insured MBC, and MCRC patients, respectively, and were in the range of 1.13 to 19.23 for privately insured NHL patients.
