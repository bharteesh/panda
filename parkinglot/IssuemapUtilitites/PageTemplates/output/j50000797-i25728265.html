The precise meanings of malak and f??ir are not the only difficulties in this aya that appear to have posed problems. The three distributive adjectives found in the aya (mathn?, thul?th and rub??) tend in modern translations to be given interpretations not found in the classical exegeses of the aya.

Within this context, the primary concern of this study revolves around the evident disagreements between them in their readings. The article identifies the specific differences which distinguish the reading of both figures, and discusses the stance of the leading Basrans or Kufans with regards to their acceptance or rejection of either of these two readings. Thus, this paper is an investigation of selected samples as a means of viewing the extent to which the qira??t of these two authors correspond with their grammatical views.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25728271</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>For Muslims the Qur'anic text is immutable, yet written versions vary enormously in materials, format and aspect.

It will posit that the new Qur'anic vision of the human future that eventually comes to replace the Biblical is not only a rejection of a previous option, it is at the same time a response to a major question raised in Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. The Qur'an thus is in conversation with two cultural traditions; the options put forward in both being debated and finally replaced.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>??? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ?????? ???????? ????? ?????? ??? ?????? ??????? ????? ?? ????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ?? ?????? ????? ??? ????? ?? ????? ????????? ??? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ?? ???? ????? ?? ??? ???? ?????? ?? ??????? ??? ????? ?? ???????? ???? ????? ?? ??????? ??? ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ?? ????? ???????? ?? ????? ??????? ????? ???? ????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ????????? ??????? ???????? ??? ????? ???? ?????? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? 136 ?????? ???? ??? ?? ??????? ??????? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???? ?? ???? ??????? ?????? ????? ??? ??????? ???? ??? ?????? ???? ?????? ?????? ??
