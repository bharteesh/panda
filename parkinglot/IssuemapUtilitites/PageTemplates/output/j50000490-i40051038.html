Seven out of ten trials reported reductions in 'any STI' with five statistically significant results. Three out of four trials reported reductions in pregnancy, although none was statistically significant. Only four trials met all the quality criteria. Trials reported a median of 11 (IQR 7— 17) outcome measures. Few trials used the same outcome measure.

Because of the low proportion of trials using the same outcome the potential for bias from selective reporting of outcomes is considerable.

This paper aims to present a simple and creative HIV incidence estimation method for resource constrained settings with scarce data.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods The authors developed a simple user-friendly non-iterative spreadsheet estimation method, which can produce incidence estimates by age group using observed cross-sectional, age-specific HIV prevalence. Data from two prospective FHI microbicide Phase III clinical trials in Nigeria were used to validate the spreadsheet method. Since both the clinical trials involved condom use promotion to reduce HIV risk, the authors also used the AVERT software to estimate the extent of incidence reduction due to the intervention.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results The spreadsheet incidence estimates after accounting for AVERT adjusted reductions, for age groups 18-20, 21-25 and 26-30 were: 1.69%, 0.96% and 1.12% in the SAVVY trial, and 2.11%, 1.47% and 1.28% in the CS trial respectively.

However, the mix of MVPA components varied across income bands, with adolescents from low-SEP families experiencing less sport but more active transport. Because the mean rate of energy expenditure was greater in sport than in other forms of MVPA (play, active transport or chores), there were significant differences in MVPA-related and total daily energy expenditure across income bands, with the lower bands having significantly lower values. Differences in total daily energy expenditure were almost entirely explained by differences in energy expenditure associated with sport.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion Physical activity patterns vary across SEP bands in Australian adolescents, with sport being the major locus of differences.

Adjusted mortality, risk difference (RD), slope index of inequality (SII), RR and relative index of inequality were calculated. The contributions of different causes of death to absolute mortality inequalities were calculated as percentages based on RD and SII.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results Injuries other than from transport accidents contributed the most to total SIIs for male deaths at ages 1-4 (30.0% for father's education). The second largest contribution was from transport accident injuries (19.6% for father's education). For male deaths at ages 5-9, transport accident injuries and other injuries also accounted for most of the educational and occupational differentials in absolute mortality (63.5-90.5%). Patterns in cause-specific contribution to total inequalities in mortality among girls were generally similar to those among boys.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions The major contributing causes to absolute socioeconomic inequality in all-cause mortality for children aged 1-9 were external. To reduce the absolute magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in childhood mortality, policy efforts should be directed towards injury prevention and treatment in South Korea.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41150941</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Study objective The aim of the study was to improve understanding of the relationships between contextual socioeconomic characteristics and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence in France.

The self-rated health of working-age respondents is measured for the years 1995-2001. Social indicators include education, occupational class, employment status, income, age, gender, minority status and marital status. Latent growth curve models are used to estimate both individual change and average national trajectories of self-rated health, conditioned on the social indicators.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results Ageing-vector graphs reveal general declines in health as people age. They also show differential patterns of change for specific national cohorts. Older cohorts in Denmark had poorer health and young cohorts in the USA had better health in 2001 than 1995. Social covariates predicted baseline health in all four countries, in ways that were consistent with welfare regime theories. Once inequalities in baseline health were accounted for, the few determinants of mean health decline occurred mainly in the USA, again in line with theoretical expectations. Finally, trajectories of health for those in average and advantaged social circumstances were similar, but disadvantaged individuals had much poorer health trajectories than 'average' individuals. The differences were greatest in the countries with lower levels of public transfers.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion National differences in self-rated health trajectories and their social correlates may be attributed partly to welfare policies.</TD></TR></table>
