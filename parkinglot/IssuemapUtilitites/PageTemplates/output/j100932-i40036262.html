Turnover rates were usually higher in the second decade of this study, and extinction rates were often dramatically higher than immigration rates in the second decade, resulting in overall decreases in species richness. Turnover did not differ significantly among island types based on generalized location and surrounding water depths, and extinctions were not more likely to occur on more exposed islands. The abundance (foliar cover) of populations that did not go extinct decreased steadily over the second decade of this study, indicating, along with higher extinction rates, a generalized decline in these insular floras.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: Although some islands may have been at or near a state of dynamic equilibrium in the first decade of this study, average species richness declined in all three archipelagos during the second decade, when extinctions greatly outnumbered immigrations. Four major hurricanes affected the study archipelagos in the second decade of this study, although the available evidence suggests that the hurricanes were not directly responsible for the declines. Indirect effects of hurricanes such as increased herbivory and possible decreased nutrient availability, along with a long-term (25 years) increase in temperature and decline in rainfall are likely contributing factors.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801918</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: The Tibetan Plateau accounts for about a quarter of the total land area of China and has a variety of ecosystems ranging from alpine tundra to evergreen tropics.

Net primary production and soil respiration increased by 0.52 and 0.22 Tg year-¹ , respectively, resulting in a regional carbon sink increase of 0.3 Tg year-¹ .By the end of the century, the regional carbon sink reached 36 Tg year" 1 and carbon storage in vegetation and soils is 32 and 16 Pg C, respectively. On the plateau, from west to east, the net primary production, soil respiration and net ecosystem production increased, due primarily to the increase of air temperature and precipitation and lowering elevation. In contrast, the decrease of carbon fluxes from south to north was primarily controlled by precipitation gradient. Dynamics of air temperature and associated soil temperature and active layer depth resulted in a higher plant carbon uptake than soil carbon release, strengthening the regional carbon sink during the century.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: We found that increasing soil temperature and deepening active layer depth enhanced soil respiration, increasing the net nitrogen mineralization rate. Together with the effects of warming air temperature and rising CO2 concentrations on photosynthesis, the stronger plant nitrogen uptake due to the enhanced available nitrogen stimulates plant carbon uptake, thereby strengthening the regional carbon sink as the rate of increase net primary production was faster than that of soil respiration. Further, the warming and associated soil thermal dynamics shifted the regional carbon sink from the middle of July in the early 20th century to early July by the end of the century. Our study suggests that soil thermal dynamics should be considered for future quantification of carbon dynamics in this climate-sensitive region.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801926</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: Few studies have attempted to assess the overall impact of fragmentation at the landscape scale.

Using a multiple nonlinear regression technique that incorporates spatial autocorrelation effects, we analysed plant community composition in relation to measures of fragmentation at the patch and landscape levels. From the resulting regression equation, we predicted community composition for every forest pixel on land-cover maps of the study areas and used these maps to calculate a landscape-level estimate of compositional change, which we term ' BioFrag'. BioFrag has a value of one if fragmentation has no detectable effect on communities within a landscape, and tends towards zero if fragmentation has a strong effect.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: We detected a weak, but significant, impact of fragmentation metrics operating at both the patch and landscape levels. Observed values of BioFrag ranged from 0.68 to 0.90, suggesting that patterns of fragmentation have medium to weak impacts on forest plant communities in New Zealand. BioFrag values varied in meaningful ways among landscapes and between the ground-cover and tree and shrub communities.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: BioFrag advances methods that describe spatial patterns of forest cover by incorporating the exact spatial patterns of observed species responses to fragmentation operating at multiple spatial scales.

In the case of deciduous species, damage was recognized by the failure of all or part of the plant to produce new leaves; all affected individual plants were labelled.

Maize planting in the northern mid-latitudes generally occurs in April and May. Daily average air temperatures are usually 12-17 °C at the time of maize planting in these regions, although soil moisture often determines planting date more directly than does temperature. Maize planting dates vary more widely in tropical regions. Spring wheat is usually planted at cooler temperatures than maize, between c. 8 and 14 °C in temperate regions.

However, planting dates in lower latitudes and planting dates of winter wheat are more difficult to predict from climate alone. In part this is because planting dates may be chosen to ensure a favourable climate during a critical growth stage, such as flowering, rather than to ensure an optimal climate early in the crop's growth. The lack of predictability is also due to the pervasive influence of technological and socio-economic factors on planting dates.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801923</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: We investigated patterns of species richness and composition of the aquatic food web found in the liquid-filled leaves of the North American purple pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea (Sarraceniaceae), from local to continental scales.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: We investigated patterns of species richness and composition of the aquatic food web found in the liquid-filled leaves of the North American purple pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea (Sarraceniaceae), from local to continental scales.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Location: We sampled 20 pitcher-plant communities at each of 39 sites spanning the geographic range of S. purpurea -from northern Florida to Newfoundland and westward to eastern British Columbia.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: Environmental predictors of variation in species composition and species richness were measured at two different spatial scales: among pitchers within sites and among sites.

Aplochiton taeniatus and Brachygalaxias bullocki have experienced reductions (8-17% loss) in total drainage area occupied, and they have disappeared from, or are now extremely difficult to find, in latitudes 36 ° to 41 ° S, coincidently with areas of urban growth and intense economic activities. The distribution of Galaxias platel has, instead, increased considerably. In northern basins, G. maculatus has apparently been replaced by an introduced poeciliid Gambusia sp. High-elevation systems remain dominated by native Galaxias platel^ whereas systems at intermediate elevations, especially rivers, are now dominated by introduced salmonids. Within drainages, native galaxiids remain abundant where exotic salmonid abundance is low.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: We suggest that negative interactions between introduced and native fish are responsible for some of the range reductions among Galaxiidae in Chile. The severity of the impacts varies with latitude and altitude and is probably related to temperature. The effects of Gambusia are restricted to warmer systems.Native fish also appear to have found temperature refugia from salmonids; impacts are low in the warmer northern and coastal systems, as well as in high-altitude relatively cold systems. Native fish also appear less vulnerable to salmonids in lakes than in rivers. This study identifies watersheds critical for the conservation of biodiversity within the Galaxiidae.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801925</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: The evolutionary speed hypothesis (ESH) attempts to explain global patterns of species richness on the basis that rates of molecular evolution and speciation in warmer climates have led to a greater accumulation of taxa at lower latitudes.

Thus, we report here on our findings for amphibians -a taxon whose phylogenetic and trophic contexts are remote from those previously tested -using genes that have also not been examined before. The study utilized paired contrasts of sister species (188 species across 18 families, including both caudates and anurans) that are spatially separated in either latitudinal or elevational dimensions.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: We found substantially faster substitution rates for species living in warmer habitats (P = 0.001-0.002) at both lower latitudes (P < 0.02) and lower elevations (P > 0.01).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: The consistency of these results with the previous studies that used quite different organisms -and in this instance also using different genes -suggests that this is a ubiquitous pattern in nature consistent with the predictions of the ESH. Recent tests of the TCH that, in estimating diversification rates, have relied on the assumption that DNA evolution occurs at a constant rate across latitudes and elevations, require reconsideration in light of the findings presented here. Our results indicate that greater caution is required when estimating dates of divergence using DNA sequence data.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801924</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: (1) To resolve theoretical debates regarding the role of environment versus dispersal limitation, the conservatism of niches across distances and the prevalence of environmental specialists in diatom communities.

Nested partial redundancy analyses (RDAs) were used to determine spatial versus environmental components of community variation. Weighted-averaging (WA) regression and calibration, as well as logistic and quadratic regressions, were used to detect niche conservatism and the prevalence of environmental specialists.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Community patterns indicate that dispersal limitation acts predominantly at the inter-continental scale, while at the regional (less than c. 1,000,000 km²) scale, a single environmental variable (pH) explains more than five times the community variation as spatial (dispersal-related) variables. In addition, pH niche components appear to be conserved at the inter-continental scale, and environmental specialization does not impose relative rarity, as specialists apparently readily disperse to suitable environments.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: Analysis at multiple scales is clearly important in determining the influences of community variation. For diatom communities, dispersal limitation acts most strongly at the broadest scales, giving way to environment at the scales considered by most analyses. The availability of a wide variety of propagules with consistent niches across regions indicates that diatom communities reflect the succession of taxa according to local environmental conditions, rather than disequilibrium with the environment or adaptation of local populations. While multiscale analyses must be undertaken for other groups to resolve debates over community drivers and determine appropriate scales for prediction, for diatoms (and probably other microbial communities), responses to environmental change can be inferred using analogue datasets from large geographic areas.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801921</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To test whether functional homogenization of bird communities is promoted by anthropogenic landscape transformation, using specialization and habitat preference indices that account for the multidimensionality of niches.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To test whether functional homogenization of bird communities is promoted by anthropogenic landscape transformation, using specialization and habitat preference indices that account for the multidimensionality of niches.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Location: Catalonia, north-east Iberian Peninsula.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: We used data on bird species occurrences and landscape features in 2834 1-km 2 squares. Three orthogonal landscape gradients, which were taken as niche dimensions, were defined by means of principal components analysis (PCA). Specialization and habitat preference indices were created for 103 terrestrial bird species on the basis of their frequency of occurrence variation along the landscape gradients. These indices, together with species rarity, were then averaged for bird communities. We then analysed the patterns of variation of communities' mean specialization, mean rarity and mean habitat preference values along a gradient of agricultural-forest habitat mosaics.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Wherever we found a significant variation in the degree of specialization along the agricultural-forest gradient, agricultural habitats held more specialized bird communities than did forest ones and bore, on average, rarer species. Thus, results contradicted our initial hypothesis that humanized areas would bear more functionally homogenized bird communities. Higher á-diversity values tended to be associated with generalist communities and with those having rarer species.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: Estimations of bird community specialization for different niche dimensions can behave differently along certain landscape gradients, and some of these differences can be explained by the variation of mean habitat preferences. Thus, we argue that a multidimensional approach to assess average niche breadth of communities can be more informative than a unidimensional measure.Our results suggest that widespread land abandonment and current secondary forest expansion throughout the Mediterranean area are promoting functional homogenization of bird communities. It would be desirable to construct largerscale indicators of functional homogenization in order to monitor communities' responses to widespread landscape changes.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801920</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To test six hypotheses that could explain or mediate the positive correlation between human population density (HPD) and bird species richness while controlling for biased sampling effort.

Inherent habitat heterogeneity was weakly related to richness and HPD, although an interaction between heterogeneity and NPP indicated that the former may be an important determinant of species richness in low-productivity regions. There was little evidence that anthropogenic landscape heterogeneity or human-induced changes in productivity influenced the relationship between species richness and HPD, but conservation policy appeared to act as an important mediating factor and species richness was positively related to the proportion of conservation land only in regions of high HPD.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: The spatial congruence between bird species richness and HPD occurs because both respond positively to productivity and, in certain circumstances, habitat heterogeneity.
