Mortalities and relative indices of inequality (RII) were calculated by parental education, sex, age group and cause of death.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results Lower parental education was associated with a higher risk of mortality during the whole period of 1990-2004. The differentials were largest among 1-4-year-old children (RII=2.4, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.56 for males and RII=4.5, 2.71 to 7.32 for females) and among young men aged 15-19 (RII=2.4, 2.00 to 2.98). The educational gradient was sharper in accidental and violent causes of death, but deaths from diseases contributed to differentials for both sexes among the youngest and the oldest.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion The association between parental education and mortality in young age was consistent, although distinctively patterned by sex, age and cause of death. The results provide some support for the idea of equalisation of health inequalities during the child—youth transition. The convergence of differences in late childhood, and re-emergence in early adulthood, particularly among men, was, however, related to changes in the cause composition of deaths.</TD></TR></table>
