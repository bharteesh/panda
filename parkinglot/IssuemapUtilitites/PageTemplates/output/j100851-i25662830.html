Individual serum TCDD levels were measured from samples collected soon after the explosion and extrapolated to the conception attempt. We examined the relation of TCDD levels to time to pregnancy (parameterized as the monthly probability of conception within the first 12 months of trying) and to infertility (defined as conception after at least 12 months of trying). We modeled fecundability with discrete-time Cox proportional hazards regression, and we modeled fertility with logistic regression.

For every 10-fold increase in serum TCDD, we observed a 25% increase in time to pregnancy (adjusted-fecundability odds ratio = 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.60–0.95]) and about a doubling in odds of infertility (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9 [95% CI = 1.1–3.2]).

Dose-response relationships were observed between exposure to second-hand smoke at home and risk of circulatory death (HR per each additional hour/d = 1.25 [1.04–1.50]). Having a partner who smokes more than 30 cigarettes per day considerably increased the risk of a circulatory death (2.94 [1.11–7.78]). Second-hand smoke exposure at home was not associated with total mortality (1.03 [0.93–1.13]).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Discussion: Exposure to second-hand smoke at home (as confirmed by plasma cotinine levels) increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25662838</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background: Ambient particles are associated with cardiovascular events and recently with total plasma homocysteine.

PM, black carbon, total plasma homocysteine, and other covariates were measured at several points in time between 1995 and 2006.

GSTT1 and HFE C282Y modified effects of black carbon on total plasma homocysteine, and HFE C282Y and CAT (rs2300181) modified effects of PM on homocysteine. Several genotypes marginally modified effects of PM and black carbon on various endpoints.
