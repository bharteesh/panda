The study builds on an ongoing community-wide investigation examining changes over time in MI incidence and case-fatality rates. We included confirmed cases of MI in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003. Long-term survival status was ascertained through 2005. A validated spatiotemporal land use regression model for traffic-related air pollution was developed and annual averages of elemental carbon at residence estimated. The effect of estimated elemental carbon on the long-term mortality of patients discharged after MI was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for a variety of demographic, medical history, and clinical variables.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Of the 3895 patients with validated MI, 44% died during follow-up.

We applied our method to the Dutch situation, analyzing severe TB cases in high-risk group children age 0–5, between 1996 and 2003.

Therefore about 9000 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 case. Vaccinating children from high-incidence countries would then cost about €4500 per discounted disability-adjusted life year averted. In the extended target group, the risk of disease is somewhat lower with a similar vaccine effectiveness, so costs are raised.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: The current Dutch BCG strategy, as well as the proposed inclusion of immigrant children from Turkey, Surinam and former Yugoslavia, is on average cost-effective.
