Seedlings appeared highly aggregated at short distances (up to 3 m), irrespective of disturbance history, and were spatially segregated with respect to large trees. However, we found no evidence of patches of even-aged seedlings, and our results suggest that dispersal events at intermediate distances (10-17 m) may be frequent.

Non-coding regions of chloroplast DNA were sequenced. The genealogical relationships among haplotypes were estimated using a statistical parsimony network. To examine the phylogeographical structure, we compared two parameters of population differentiation, namely G and N, and conducted correlation analysis of genetic and geographical distances.

Based on the divergence time, over-sea dispersal in the Pleistocene is likely, although migration via a Pliocene landbridge is not totally rejected. Negligible genetic differentiation across the Tokara Gap suggests recent over-sea dispersal, possibly facilitated by the small geographical width of the gap. Conversely, the large genetic differentiation across the Kerama Gap is probably explained by the large geographical distance across it. The past splitting of a landbridge would have had a significant influence on population differentiation after a certain geographical distance was reached.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40928994</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: In Europe, the relationships between species richness and latitude differ for lentie (standing water) and lotie (running water) species.

The distributions of lentie species appear to be closer to equilibrium than those of lotie species.

Native populations showed clines in development time with elevation consistent with expectations. However, these were weaker in introduced populations, the responses of which were rather characterized by phenotypic plasticity.

In contrast, high-latitude evergreen species on average showed greater development of traits that should enhance water uptake. This was particularly evident in Nothofagus cunninghamii from southern Australia, which developed low water potentials at moderate levels of tissue water deficit and higher root: leaf biomass than tropical species, potentially allowing carbon assimilation to be maximized during warmer, but drier, summer months.

However, spread of tropical species to higher latitudes may be limited by water conservation strategies that limit carbon gain in climates in which temperature seasonality is often paired with drier summers. Evergreen species from high latitudes, such as N cunninghamii, commonly showed traits that should increase water uptake. However, this strategy, while probably maximizing growth in temperate climates with cool winters and drier summers, must limit competitiveness at lower latitudes in summer-wet climates. We conclude that responses to water regimes may make a significant contribution to the latitudinal limits of some evergreen rain forest species.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40928987</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: The aim of community-level modelling is to improve the performance of species distributional models by taking patterns of co-occurrence among species into account.

We used data from repeated visits to 1-ha pixels to derive 'detection histories' and apply site-occupancy models to estimate the 'true' species distribution, i.e. corrected for imperfect detection.

We compared the site-occupancy model with a conventional distribution model based on a generalized linear model, which assumes perfect detectability (p = 1). The conventional distribution map looked very different from the distribution map obtained using site-occupancy models that accounted for the imperfect detection. The conventional model underestimated the species distribution by 60%, and the slope parameters of the occurrence-elevation relationship were also underestimated when assuming p = 1. Elevation was not only an important predictor of blue hawker occurrence, but also of the detection probability, with a bell-shaped relationship. Furthermore, detectability increased over the season. The average detection probability was estimated at only 0.19 per survey.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: Conventional species distribution models do not model species distributions per se but rather the apparent distribution, i.e. an unknown proportion of species distributions. That unknown proportion is equivalent to detectability. Imperfect detection in conventional species distribution models yields underestimates of the extent of distributions and covariate effects that are biased towards zero. In addition, patterns in detectability will erroneously be ascribed to species distributions. In contrast, site-occupancy models applied to replicated detection/non-detection data offer a powerful framework for making inferences about species distributions corrected for imperfect detection. The use of 'cheap' checklist data greatly enhances the scope of applications of this useful class of models.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40928991</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To examine the response of forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages and feeding guilds to patch characteristics of forest fragments in the context of island biogeography and metapopulation theories in an area that supports high levels of species diversity and endemism.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To examine the response of forest-dependent and generalist bird assemblages and feeding guilds to patch characteristics of forest fragments in the context of island biogeography and metapopulation theories in an area that supports high levels of species diversity and endemism.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Location: Dune, riverine, sand and swamp forest fragments in southern Mozambique's Maputaland.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: We recorded 20 forest-dependent and 69 generalist bird species at 220 survey points in 30 forest fragments that ranged in size from 5 to 7432 ha and that were 100 to 5100 m apart.

In the Alps, most populations are at least close to formerly unglaciated areas.

Optimal ancestral reconstructions suggest that the diversification of the tribe Cynolebiasini in north-eastern South America was first caused by vicariance events in the Paranã-Urucuia-São Francisco area, followed by dispersal from the São Francisco to the Northeastern Brazil area. The latter dispersal event occurred simultaneously in two different cynolebiasine clades, possibly as a result of a temporary connection of the São Francisco area before the uplift of the Borborema Plateau during the Miocene. The diversity of cynolebiasines inhabiting the Paraguay area is hypothesized to be derived from two processes: an older vicariance event (about 30 Ma) separating Paraguay from southern Amazonian areas (Guaporé-Xingu-Araguaia-Tocantins), and a series of more recent dispersal and vicariance events (about 15-11 Ma) caused by successive marine transgressions, which permitted alternating biotic exchange and isolation in the Paraguay, La Plata, Negro and Patos areas.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: DIVA indicates there to have been a series of vicariance events congruent with tectonic episodes in South America, but the present distribution of cynolebiasines has also been shaped by a series of dispersal events.
