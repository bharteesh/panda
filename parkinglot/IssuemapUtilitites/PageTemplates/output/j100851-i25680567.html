We excluded arrests with an obvious preceding noncardiac event such as trauma, poisoning, or drowning, leaving only those events that were presumed to have cardiac etiology.

We estimated exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO?), particulate matter less than 2.5 ?m in aerodynamic diameter (PM), black smoke, sulfur dioxide (SO?), and various traffic indicators for participants' 2000 home addresses. Exposure for the year 2000 was estimated by land-use regression models incorporating regional background annual air pollution levels, land-use variables, population densities, and traffic intensities on nearby roads.

Twelve- and 24-month manganese concentrations were correlated (Spearman correlation = 0.55) and levels declined over time (? = -5.7 [95% CI = -6.2 to -5.1]). We observed an inverted U-shaped association between 12-month blood manganese and concurrent mental development scores (compared with the middle 3 manganese quintiles, for the lowest manganese quintile, ? = -3.3 [-6.0 to -0.7] and for the highest manganese quintile, ? = -2.8 [-5.5 to -0.2]).

Twins have elevated mortality, yet they usually have lower mortality than singletons at most preterm weeks. Twinning itself is a cause of early birth. Thus, at any given preterm week, singletons are more likely than twins to have pathologic causes of preterm delivery. If any such cause is associated with a mortality risk higher than that conferred by twinning, it is possible for singletons to have higher mortality than twins at some preterm weeks. Thus, mortality of twins at those weeks comes closer to describing the risk due to immaturity itself. To exclude high-risk babies, we focused on singletons and twins least likely to have suffered fetal growth disruptions (ie, those with "optimal" birth weight). At each gestational week from 24 to 36, we identified (for twins and singletons separately) the 500-gram weight category with the lowest neonatal mortality, and selected the lower of the 2 mortality rates.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Using the above as our best estimates of mortality due to immaturity alone, we calculated that about half the mortality of singleton preterm babies was due to the pathologies that cause early delivery.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Factors that cause preterm birth apparently contribute a large proportion of preterm mortality.

We assessed whether various village-level variables were associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms in a resettled postconflict population in Liberia.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: Individual surveys were administered to a population-based sample (n = 1434). We used multilevel random intercept linear regression models to estimate associations between individual- and village-level variables and posttraumatic-stress-symptom score.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: In a multilevel model taking into account individual-level covariates, living in a village with higher mean number of traumatic experiences or greater history of displacement was associated with a higher symptom score. Conversely, living in a village with a more equal distribution of household wealth was associated with lower symptom score.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Characteristics of communities, as well as of individuals, may be important determinants of posttraumatic stress in low-income countries, such as Liberia, that are recovering from conflict.</TD></TR></table>
