This article describes and discusses the methodology used to identify the critical variables required to assess coastal vulnerability to oil spills. The first part introduces previous research and identifies the parameters that have been used to map this type of vulnerability. The study area is presented in the second part of the paper. The third part presents the method we used to compute a spatialised vulnerability index that is based on a multicriteria analysis including both environmental and socioeconomic parameters. The final part of this paper describes and discusses the results of the implementation of this method on Noirmoutier Island located off the west coast of France. The resulting synthetic mapping for risk monitoring, carried out using a geographical information system, seems to be a relevant and useful complementary tool to improve the management of oil spill crises.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40863886</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>The coastal lagoon adjacent to the River Murray mouth has been filling with sediment brought in from the ocean by tidal currents for at least the last 170 years.

Analysis of water-level data in the lagoon showed that flood durations were usually shorter than ebb durations, which demonstrated the occurrence of flood dominance. It was also found that the degree of flood dominance has reduced since dredging. The dredging has led to fewer, deeper channels and hence a reduction in the degree of flood dominance. The main conclusion is that it has been possible to manipulate the tidal asymmetry through the use of dredging and move the lagoon system towards ebb dominance and, therefore, natural flushing.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40863885</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Climate change will have pervasive effects on the world's coasts, but at broad scales these changes have typically proven difficult to analyse in a systematic manner.

Therefore, significant potential exists to guide future coastal evolution toward preferred outcomes by using this approach as a component of adaptive shoreline management. This methodology could be applied to a wide range of problems both in geomorphology and other subjects.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40863896</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>A SIBEO (Spanish acronym for sistema de bombeo por energía de oleaje) wave-driven seawater pump is proposed for managing the volume and salinity of a coastal lagoon on the Mexican Pacific coast.

La variación del volumen y la salinidad de la laguna Lagartero, durante la mayor parte del año que permanece cerrada la boca-barra de arena, es adecuadamente reproducida por un modelo que asume un balance evaporación— precipitación controlado en una cuenca cerrada. El modelo fue empleado para examinar la aplicación de un SIBEO para controlar el volumen y la salinidad de la laguna. El bombeo continuo de agua de mar mantiene un nivel de agua que favorece el mayor número de aperturas de la boca-barra de arena al final de la temporada de lluvias y por lo tanto, la entrada de larvas de camarón, sin afectar significativamente el ciclo anual de salinidad observado. Se discuten los posibles efectos del agua de mar bombeada por el SIBEO sobre la eutrofización lagunar y la producción de camarón, concluyéndose que es probable que el SIBEO ayude a reducir la eutrofización y aumentar significativamente la producción de camarón en la laguna.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40863883</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Ecogeomorphological modeling in salt marshes faces distinct challenges due to tidal oscillation and variability, fieldwork logistics, and the inherent dynamic nature of these environments.

These analyses are complicated by human interference in the form of ditches, which have the general effect of both draining ponds and inhibiting pond formation, altering the natural distribution of drained ponds, pannes, and water-filled ponds. However, the geomorphic distribution of pannes and ponds indicates strong elevational control on feature formation, most likely as a function of depth and duration of inundation.</TD></TR></table>
