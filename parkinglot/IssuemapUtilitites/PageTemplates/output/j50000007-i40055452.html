We expressed recombinant DbpA and DbpB of B. garinii, B. afzelii, and B. burgdorferi ss and studied their binding to decorin. We also generated recombinant Borrelia strains to study the role of DbpA and DbpB in the adhesion of live spirochetes to decorin and decorin-expressing cells.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Recombinant DbpA of B. garinii and DbpB of B. garinii and B. burgdorferi ss showed strong binding to decorin, whereas DbpA of B. burgdorferi ss and both DbpA and DbpB of B. afzelii exhibited no or only minor binding activity. DbpA and DbpB of B. garinii and B. burgdorferi ss also supported the adhesion of whole spirochetes to decorin and decorin-expressing cells, whereas DbpA and DbpB of B. afzelii did not exhibit this activity.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. Dbp A and B of B. garinii and B. burgdorferi ss mediate the interaction between the spirochete and decorin, whereas the same adhesins of B. afzelii show only negligible activity.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41230369</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Introduction.

The meta-analysis included 26 eligible studies of behavioral interventions, substance use treatment, syringe access, syringe disinfection, and multicomponent interventions. Interventions using multiple combined strategies reduced risk of seroconversion by 75% (pooled relative risk, .25; 95% confidence interval, .07-.83). Effects of single-method interventions ranged from .6 to 1.6.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. Interventions using strategies that combined substance-use treatment and support for safe injection were most effective at reducing HCV seroconversion. Determining the effective dose and combination of interventions for specific subgroups of PWID is a research priority. However, our meta-analysis shows that HCV infection can be prevented in PWID.</TD></TR></table>
