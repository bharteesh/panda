Twenty-eight participants were exposed to monodispersed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) particles (4.9 ?m) in 6 groups: group 1, no precautions; group 2, ocular exposure only; group 3, surgical mask without eye protection; group 4, surgical mask with eye protection; group 5, fit-tested N95 respirator without eye protection; and group 6, fit-tested N95 respirator with eye protection. Influenza was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and culture in nasal washes. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Influenza was detected in 4 of 4 participants in group 1 (95% CI, 0—.60), 3 of 4 in group 2 (95% CI, .006—.806]), 5 of 5 in group 3 (95% CI, 0—.522), 5 of 5 in group 4, (95% CI, 0—.522), 3 of 5 in group 5 (95% CI, .053—.853), and 1 of 5 in group 6 (95% CI, .05—.72).

Transocular transmission of LAIV occured in most participants suggesting the necessity of eye protection. An N95 respirator provided the best guard further enhanced by eye protection.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41230514</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Objective.

This study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 315,550 patients with herpes zoster were included as the study group, and the control group consisted of 946,650 randomly selected subjects.

After adjusting for monthly income and geographic region, the hazard of MS was 3.96 times greater (95% CI = 222-7.07, ñ < 0.001) for the study group than controls.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. Our findings support the notion that occurrence of MS could be associated with herpes zoster attack. We found a significantly higher risk for MS within 1 year of herpes zoster attack compared with the control population.</TD></TR></table>
