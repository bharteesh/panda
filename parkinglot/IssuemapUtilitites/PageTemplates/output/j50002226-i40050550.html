Already, the use by insurers of postcode data for U.K. flood risk assessment has carried over to U.K. mortality assessment. Powered by fast numerical computation and parameterised with high quality geographical data, hydrological models of flood risk have superseded the traditional statistical insurance loss models. A decade later, medically-motivated computational models of mortality risk can be expected to gain increasing prominence in longevity risk management.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41141763</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>In 1900 life expectancy at birth in the UK was only 46 years for men and 53 years for women.

We propose a simple model of stochastic variation that is easy to explain and to implement, which could be an alternative to and/or complete some of the well known models. The model can be applied to any best estimates of future mortality rates, as it aims to describe how longevity behaves around the projected expected values.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>The paper proposes a possible calibration on the England and Wales population mortality that produces a minimum indication of possible future variation and uses the results to validate the model's assumptions.

The advantage lasts into older ages, decades after migration. We hypothesise that migrants from the U.K.'s golden cohort brought with them an early life mortality improvement advantage, and additionally benefited from the healthier environment of New Zealand at middle to older ages. Further, given the recent strong mortality improvement in New Zealand, the U.K.'s assumptions for future mortality look relatively optimistic.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41141764</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>The mortality data (registered deaths and population size) over the years 1961-2007 for the population of England and Wales and for Scotland were obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and from the Scottish Registrar General.
