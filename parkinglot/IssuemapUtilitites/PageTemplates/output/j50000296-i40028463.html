The technicalities of the new proofs are somewhat more subtle, and they also throw up a nice connection to a basic problem in combinatorial number theory, namely the study of subsets of finite cyclic groups which avoid non-trivial solutions to one or more translation invariant linear equations.</TD></TR></table>
