High-resolution HLA class I and II genotyping was conducted in a prospective cohort of 519 human immunodeficiency virus (HlV)-seropositive and 100 HIV-seronegative women with persistent HCV infection. The end points were baseline HCV viral load and 2 noninvasive indexes of liver disease, fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), and the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), measured at baseline and prospectively.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. DQBl* 0301 was associated with low baseline HCV load (?= -. 4; 95% confidence interval [CI], -.6 to -. 3 ; P <; .00001), as well as with low odds of FIB-4-defined (odds ratio [OR], .5; 95% CI, .2-9; P = .02) and APRI-defined liver fibrosis (OR, .5; 95% CI, .3-1.0; P = .06) at baseline and/or during follow-up. Most additional associations with HCV viral load also involved HLA class II alleles. Additional associations with FIB-4 and APRI primarily involved class I alleles, for example, the relation of B* 1503 with APRI-defined fibrosis had an OR of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0-3.7; P = .04).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. HLA genotype may influence HCV viral load and risk of liver disease, including DQB1* 0301, which was associated with HCV clearance in prior studies.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41229954</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Introduction.

To determine the role of osteopontin in the host response during pneumococcal pneumonia, osteopontin knockout (KO) and normal wild-type (WT) mice were intranasally infected with viable S. pneumoniae.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Pneumonia was associated with a rapid increase in pulmonary osteopontin concentrations in WT mice from 6 h onward. Osteopontin KO mice showed a prolonged survival relative to WT mice, which was accompanied by diminished pulmonary bacterial growth and reduced dissemination to distant body sites. In addition, at 48 h after infection pulmonary inflammation was decreased in osteopontin KO mice as reflected by lower inflammation scores and reduced chemokine concentrations. In contrast to pneumococcal pneumonia, osteopontin deficiency did not influence bacterial growth in primary pneumococcal sepsis induced by direct intravenous infection, suggesting that the detrimental effect of osteopontin on antibacterial defense during pneumonia primarily is exerted in the pulmonary compartment. Moreover, recombinant osteopontin stabilized S. pneumoniae viability in vitro.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions.
