TLR2 activation by the HCV core protein leads to a decrease in interleukin 6 (IL-6) production by human APCs after subsequent stimulation with TLR2 (homotolerance) ligands and TLR4 (cross-tolerance) ligands. This hyporesponsiveness induced by preexposure to the HCV core protein was partially mediated by the negative regulation of nuclear factor-?B activation by the induction of IRAK-M. TLR ligand-induced IL-6 production was significantly reduced in peripheral blood monocytes isolated from HCV-infected patients, compared with those of healthy control subjects.

MT2816/Rv2745c expression was induced in M. tuberculosis following redox stress, heat shock and acid shock and intracellular replication. Its expression was also induced by SDS and thioridazine, agents that impact M. tuberculosis cell-envelope. However, exposure to isoniazid or ethambutol, front-line antituberculosis drugs which also target the cell envelope, did not induce the expression of MT2816/Rv2745c. Studies using ?-? and ?-? mutants showed that ? was required for the induction of MT2816/Rv2745c. Conditional expression of the MT2816/Rv2745c in M. tuberculosis showed that apart from regulating proteolysis, this gene may control the expression of trehalose biosynthesis and impact the maintenance of cellular redox potential and energy generation.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. The protein encoded by MT2816/Rv2745c is important for the pathogen's response to stress conditions that mimic in vivo growth and it is subject to complex regulation. The MT2816/Rv2745c encoded protein likely functions by protecting intracellular redox potential and by inducing the expression of trehalose, a constituent of M. tuberculosis cell walls that is important for defense against cell-surface and oxidative stress.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/20780207</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background.

Using assays for virulence-associated exoproducts, biofilm formation, Caenorhabditis elegans killing, and a murine model of acute respiratory infection, we compared the pathogenic behavior of representatives of 4 subtypes of the LES, including LES431, an isolate associated with the infection of a parent without CF.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. The quorum-sensing—defective lasR mutant LES400 produced less exoproduct and had less C. elegans killing activity than the other LES subtypes, which were represented by LES431, LESB58, and LESB65. LES431 was deficient in biofilm formation, compared with the other LES sub-types. The LES subtypes displayed a range of virulence in the mouse model, with LES431 being by far the most virulent. The genome-sequenced isolate LESB58, effective at establishing infections in a rat model of chronic infection, was the least virulent subtype in the murine acute infection model.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. LES isolates display widely variable pathogenic characteristics. LES431, associated with transmission to the non-CF parent of a CF patient, represents a "hypervirulent" subtype more adapted to acute infections than chronic infections.</TD></TR></table>
