The five sepals originated in a helical pattern, followed evidently by simultaneous initiation of five stamens and five petals, the former opposite of the sepals and the latter alternate to them. The gynoecium, with five carpels, was produced from the remaining, central region of the floral apex. Stamens at early stages were dominated by anther growth but filaments elongated rapidly shortly before anthesis. Early gynoecium development occurred predominantly in the ovary, and ovule initiation began prior to enclosure of carpels. A characteristic feature was the twisted growth of styles, accompanied by the differentiation of papillate stigmas. Petal growth lagged behind that of other floral organs, but petals eventually grew rapidly to enclose the inner whorls after style elongation. Flask-shaped nectaries bearing stomata developed on the external surface of the filament bases.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: This is the first detailed study on flax floral organ development and has established a key of 12 developmental stages, which should be useful to flax researchers.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27975376</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: The difference reported in the literature for the Specific Leaf Area (SLA, cm

Life-history (annuality/perenniality), capitulum structure, capitular sexual system, and M/F were reconstructed on time-proportional phylogenies.

These results are largely supported by PIC analysis. Different sexual systems afford differing flexibility in sex allocation, with hermaphrodites having the least, and monoecious taxa the greatest, range in M/F. Within Ifloga, the anomalous capitulum evolved in an annual, gynomonoecious ancestor, followed by two independent gains of monoecy. Two subsequent gains of perenniality occurred within a monoecious sublineage.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Different life histories have divergent sex allocation optima and are strongly associated with different sexual systems in gnaphalioid daisies.
