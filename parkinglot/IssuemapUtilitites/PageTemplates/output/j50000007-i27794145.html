At enrollment in 1994–1995, children (n = 307) in a rural Wisconsin health maintenance organization received MMR2 at age 4–6 years. A comparison group of older children (n = 306) was vaccinated at age 9–11 years. Serum specimens were collected during a 12-year period.

A total of 1601 women were randomized to receive MQ (n = 802) or SP (n = 799).

The incidence rate of community-acquired neonatal bacteremia was 3.0 per 1000 person–neonatal periods.

Fifteen patients with HCV genotype 1 infection with or without HIV infection were recruited for the present study, and the decrease in the HCV RNA level was measured at early time points. The evolution of HCV NS5A quasispecies within the first week was analyzed by comparing the clones observed at later times in the study with the baseline consensus sequence of individual patients. The response to therapy was defined as an early response (ER; ie, an HCV RNA level <615 IU/mL at week 4) or a slow response (SR; ie, a detectable HCV RNA level at week 4).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. HIV infection did not affect early viral kinetics. At baseline, lower diversity was seen in NS5A and in the amino and carboxyl termini of patients with an ER, compared with those with an SR. Rapid evolution of the NS5A genetic region occurred in patients with an ER (P = .01) but not in those with an SR (P = .73). The evolution was the result of an increase in the number of amino acid substitutions in the carboxyl region (P = .02) in patients with an ER.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. Selective pressure appears to result in more-marked changes in individuals with an ER than in those with an SR. The carboxyl terminus was subject to the most change and may be an important determinant of phenotypic resistance to interferon-based therapy.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27794162</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background.

An observational study characterized relationships between clinical factors, pharmacokinetics, and treatment response among antiretroviral-naive patients initiating once-daily treatment with efavirenz plus twice-daily treatment with zidovudine and lamivudine.

Plasma specimens for efavirenz analysis were obtained from study participants a mean (± standard deviation) of 13.9 ± 1.6 h after they received the dose. As expected, CYP2B6 516G?T was associated with increased plasma efavirenz concentrations (Spearman ? = 0.71; P < .001), as were 10 polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with 516G?T. Distinct CYP2B6 polymorphisms were associated with decreased plasma efavirenz concentrations (greatest absolute ? = 0.48; P = .001).

We detected higher levels of HIV-1 transcription in the ectocervix. Although CD45 expression was also increased at this site, higher levels of HIV-1 transcription could not be accounted for exclusively by differences in CD45 expression. This suggests that factors other than CD45 levels regulate HIV-1 transcription within the ectocervix. We detected higher levels of interleukin (IL)–6 at this site. Futhermore, addition of recombinant IL-6 to tissue explants enhanced HIV-1 transcription to a much greater degree in the ectocervix than in the endometrium.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to compare ectocervix and endometrium in a tissue explant model of HIV-1 infection and to demonstrate greater HIV-1 transcription in the ectocervix. Our results suggest that the ectocervix is more conducive to HIV-1 replication than is the endometrium and that IL-6 enhances HIV-1 transcription at this site. Thus, the ectocervix is an important site to be considered in heterosexual transmission of HIV-1.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27794160</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background.
