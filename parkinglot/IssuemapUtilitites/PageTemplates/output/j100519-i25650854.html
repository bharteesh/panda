This article argues that taking gossip seriously as a mode of engagement with art both amplifies our understanding of the meanings, functions, and pleasures of narrative painting, and suggests specific connections between exhibition culture and the meanings of pictures. Using the richly documented reception of the 'problem pictures' of the 1910s and 1920s as the primary evidence, this article establishes a taxonomy of gossipy modes of engagement with narrative painting, and argues that gossiping about pictures allowed for the performance of individual identity, the creation of social and artistic groups, and connected public and private understandings of the world.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25650857</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Over the course of his long career, the German historian and Warburgian Percy Ernst Schramm (1894—1970) repeatedly proposed that images of Ottonian rulers had the capacity to stand in for them in their physical absence.

Indeed, since they ensured the proper commemoration of the ruler during his lifetime and well into the future, they were portraits and a crucial locus of a Nachleben of Antique forms.

At its core, Schramm's ideas get to the heart of the polyvalent representational strategies present in the objects and images he studied. Moreover, they implicitly recognise elements that are essential to pre-modern portraiture. Mistakenly looking to the hierarchies represented in early medieval portraits as ideal, Schramm worked hard to support their realisation in his own time.</TD></TR></table>
