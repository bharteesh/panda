Parental attitudes and safety concerns, the presence of social support from parents and friends and parent-reported neighbourhood walkability were all found to be predictors of active commuting, with children receiving peer and family support and living in supportive environments being more likely to walk or cycle.

This study seeks to contribute to the evidence base on the use of positive social networks for young people's health by exploring the importance of club participation in predicting the health and health-related behaviours of 15-year-old girls and boys across Europe and North America.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: Data are derived from a 2005-6 World Health Organization collaborative study, to establish the relationships between different types of club and a range of health outcomes (self-perceived health, wellbeing and symptoms) and health-related behaviours (smoking, drinking). Multi-level logistic regression was used to assess the independent effects of club participation by controlling for gender and socioeconomic position. Data were compared across six countries.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: All the considered outcomes, both in terms of perceived health and wellbeing and health behaviours were associated with participation in formal associations. The associations are in the expected direction (participation corresponding to better health) except for some particular association types.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Participation in formal associations seems supportive for good health and health behaviours in adolescence, and should be promoted in this age group.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/20721127</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background: Unemployment is associated with increased risk of mortality.

After excluding children with co-occurring problems, conduct-only problems remained a significant risk for sons of heavy smokers, OR 1.92 (95% CI 1.29 to 2.86); and hyperactivity—inattention only for sons of light or heavy smokers, OR 1.79 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.51) and 1.64 (1.10 to 2.46). Daughters of light or heavy smokers were at significant risk of conduct-only problems, OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.61) and 1.73 (1.06 to 2.83). Relative to non-smokers, daughters of pregnancy quitters had significantly reduced odds of having conduct 0.61(0.39 to 0.97) or co-occurring problems 0.26(0.08 to 0.82), although only 79 and 20 girls met these criteria, respectively.
