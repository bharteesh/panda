BP and anthropometry were assessed biannually (1999/2000, 2002, 2004) at mean ages 12.8, 15.2, and 17.0.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: On average, systolic BP increased by 11.1 mm Hg in boys and 3.2 mm Hg in girls during 5 years. Changes in height explained half of the overall increase in systolic BP in boys and virtually all of the increase in systolic BP in girls. No meaningful sex differences were observed in the association of changes in BMI, waist circumference, and triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness with systolic BP change during 5 years. Increases in 1 BMI unit, 1 cm waist circumference, or 1 mm triceps or subscapular skinfold thickness were associated with increases of 0.7, 0.24, 0.3, and 0.4 mm Hg systolic BP, respectively.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Although sex differences in mean systolic BP changes during adolescence were largely attributable to differences in gains in height, the effect of gaining weight or body fat on systolic BP change was similar in boys and girls.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25662865</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background: Social risk factors are often less vigorously pursued in clinical assessments of infant risk than are biologic risk factors.

Predictors were 3 routinely assessed biologic risks (birth weight, gestational age, and Apgar score) and 3 prominent social factors (mother's age, parent marital status, and socioeconomic status). Outcomes were childhood hospitalization and passage of a required high school examination. Analyses included logistic regression, measures of accuracy, and population attributable risk percent (PAR%).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Biologic and social risk factors were associated with similarly steep poor outcomes gradients. Social risk factors had similar, and in some cases stronger, measures of association and accuracy. Using biologic risk criteria alone misclassified as low-risk 65% of cohort children who had high rates of later hospitalization and examination failure. PAR% associated with social risk factors exceeded biologic risk factors in most cases (eg, hospitalization PAR% = 4.4 for offspring of teen mothers vs. 1.7 for low birth weight).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: In a population-based sample of infants followed-up through adolescence, early social risk factors were as threatening as, and more common than, routinely documented biologic risks—frequently identifying otherwise-unrecognized at-risk children. These findings together suggest that rigorous evaluation of social factors should be made a routine part of clinical assessment to more comprehensively and accurately identify infants at risk for later serious health problems and academic failure.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25662868</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background: The cause of historically higher rates of invasive pneumococcal disease among blacks than whites has remained unknown.

Race/ethnicity was ascertained from birth certificates. Children were followed through 2005 until loss of enrollment, pneumococcal disease episode, fifth birthday, or death. We calculated incidence rates by race/ethnicity and hemoglobin type before and after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduction. Poisson regression analyses compared invasive pneumococcal disease rates among blacks with sickle cell trait or hemoglobin C trait with whites and blacks with normal hemoglobin, controlling for age, gender, time (pre-PCV7, transition year, or post-PCV7) and high-risk conditions (eg, heart disease).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Over 10 years, 415 invasive pneumococcal disease episodes occurred during 451,594 observed child-years.

Post-PCV7, rates declined for all groups.

We used multivariable negative binomial regression to examine the association of growth trajectory (5 categories) from birth to 12 months with subsequent hospital admissions until the child's 8th birthday.

Infants in the 4 faster growth trajectories differed little in their risk of hospitalization. Adjusted incident rate ratios of hospitalization for infectious diseases were 0.93 (95% confidence interval = 0.81–1.06), 0.97 (0.85–1.12), 0.91 (0.78–1.06), and 0.92 (0.79–1.08) for the 4 faster growth trajectories compared with the slowest. Results were similar when growth was assessed as change in weight-for-age z-score.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion: Fast infant growth does not protect against serious infectious morbidity, but low birth weight infants born with slow growth are more vulnerable to serious morbidity, either as a consequence of poor growth or as a parallel marker of underlying health state. Whether maximum growth rates are ideal should be considered, as should the effects of infant over-nutrition.</TD></TR></table>
