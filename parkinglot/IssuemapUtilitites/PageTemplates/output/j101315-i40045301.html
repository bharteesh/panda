Debido a su uso la legislación mexicana la ha designado como especie sujeta a protección especial. A pesar de que la extracción es ilícita, muchas biznagas continúan siendo destrozadas in situ por colectas y por forrajeo del ganado. Este estudio describe el uso de la especie, así como las características de su población en el centro de México. Con la finalidad de estimar la densidad, el porcentaje de plantas dañadas y la altura del estrato de las biznagas, se realizaron censos en parcelas de 2,500 m². El disturbio antropogénico fue estimado a través de un índice de disturbio (DI) en cada sitio. Los resultados muestran que el estado de Hidalgo tiene la población mejor conservada (promedio de densidad= 1,111 ind/ha, una altura del estrato= 137 cm y con tan solo el 2% de las biznagas dañadas). Las poblaciones en Puebla representan una estado intermedio de conservación, mientras que las poblaciones de Querétaro presentan las densidades más bajas (435 ind/ha), las menores alturas (62 cm), un forrajeo más elevado (18%) y los mayores DI (71.30).

El caimito (Chrysophyllum cainito L., Sapotaceae) es cultivado, por su fruto comestible, en todas las regiones tropicales de América. Hemos estudiado esta especie en Panamá central, donde crece en huertos caseros y en poblaciones silvestres del bosque húmedo tropical. Usando frutos colectados en dos años de cosecha, probamos la hipótesis de que las semillas y los frutos de individuos cultivados e individuos silvestres de C. cainito tienen características distintas debido a la domesticación. Encontramos que los frutos de los individuos cultivados fueron significativa y sustancialmente más grandes, con mayor cantidad de pulpa y menos exocarpo que los frutos de individuos silvestres. La pulpa de la fruta de los individuos cultivados fue menos ácida, con menor concentración de compuestos fenólicos y alta concentración de azúcares. Las semillas fueron más grandes, numerosas y con menor autodefensas (compuestos fenólicos) en los individuos cultivados que en los silvestres. El análisis discriminante mostró, entre muchas diferencias significativas, que el tamaño de la fruta y la concentración de azucares fueron los factores más importantes para discriminir entre individuos cultivados y silvestres. La varianza entre individuos fue significativamente mayor dentro de los árboles silvestres que dentro de los árboles cultivados, para los compuestos fenólicos de la pulpa. En contraste, la varianza fue significativamente mayor entre árboles cultivados para el peso de la fruta y número de semillas. La mayoría de las características demostraron una fuerte correlación entre años. En general, encontramos un patrón claro para el síndrome de la domesticación en la fruta de caimito en Panamá.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41001173</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Bangladesh is often recognized as a secondary center of diversity for jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) and is expected to harbor important genetic diversity of this underutilized tree crop.

The aim of this study was to carry out a village-based survey and make morphological measurements to document and assess jackfruit diversity across trees associated with a gradient of three locations/habitats (homesteads, public lands, and forest or fallow lands). We also tested the hypotheses that cultivated jackfruit found in homesteads exhibited positive selection pressure for characteristics desirable in the market, and that the tree location reflected its history of origin and human selection. This was accomplished using 28 standardized morphological descriptors and represents the first large-scale assessment (900 trees) of jackfruit diversity in multiple locations (nine villages). Among the descriptors studied, those most closely associated with jackfruit marketability showed a trend for selection among the trees located in homesteads. Both fruits and leaves were larger in plants on homesteads compared to plants in forest/fallow lands, and fruit quality was significantly higher in homestead trees compared to the other two location categories. However, 18.7% and 23.7% of the fruits found on public lands and forest/fallow lands, respectively, were still considered to be of excellent fruit quality and tree vigor was significantly higher in jackfruit in forest/fallow lands compared to the other location categories. The combination of high tree vigor and presence of excellent fruit quality among jackfruit in forest/fallow lands suggests that the "wild" Bangladeshi jackfruit germplasm, which is considered inferior for market and is being negatively impacted, has valuable genetic diversity to contribute to jackfruit cultivation.

Sono state proposte ipotesi alternative che propongono un'origine Nord Atlantica oppure Mediterranea. In mancanza di prove archeologiche, considerazioni linguistiche e letterarie possono offrire qualche indicazione a proposito. Le prime opere scritte delle letterature greca antica e latina contengono espressioni che fanno riferimento ad una consolidata conoscenza e ad un utilizzo ben radicato di queste colture. Viceversa, i documenti scritti lasciati dalle civiltà antiche dell' Egitto e del Medio Oriente non hanno lasciato tracce riferibili alla presenza di cavoli. La terminologia utilizzata nelle lingue moderne europee per indicare i cavoli può essere fatta risalire etimologicamente a radici latine greche, in particolare a quei termini che indicano la caratteristica morfologica più evidente che avevano le forme domestiche primitive, cioè il robusto fusto eretto (kaulos, caulis). La tradizione celtica non ha lasciato documenti scritti prima dell'era volgare, se non iscrizioni su pietra, e non e' stata tramandata alcuna chiara evidenza di una tradizione celtica dell'utilizzo dei cavoli. Questo articolo raccoglie informazioni appartenenti alle sfere linguistica, letteraria e storica, tutte compatibili con una domesticazione di B. olerácea avvenuta nell'area di diffusione della antica lingua greca, cioè nel Mediterraneo Centrale ed Orientale.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41001175</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>This paper evaluates the impacts of traditional management on the population dynamics of Agave marmoratã, a multipurpose, useful species that is dominant in the Zapotitlán Salinas Valley, Puebla, Mexico.
