NU14-infected mice exhibited pelvic pain, whereas mice infected with 83972 did not exhibit pain, similar to patients infected with 83972. NU14-induced pain was not dependent on mast cells, not correlated with bacterial colonization or urinary neutrophils. UTI pain was not influenced by expression of type 1 pili, the bacterial adhesive appendages that induce urothelial apoptosis. However, purified NU14 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent pain, whereas 83972 LPS induced no pain. Indeed, 83972 LPS attenuated the pain of NU14 infection, suggesting therapeutic potential.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. These data suggest a novel mechanism of infection-associated pain that is dependent on TLR4 yet independent of inflammation.

Dose-effect and dose-scheduling studies were performed with ethambutol and log-phase growth Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify exposures and schedules linked to optimal kill and resistance suppression.In one study after 7 days of daily ethambutol, 300 mg isoniazid per day was administered to each system to determine its early bactericidal activity.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Efflux-pump blockage reduced the mutation frequency to ethambutol 64-fold. In dose-effect studies, ethambutol had a maximal early bactericidal activity of 0.22 log 10 colony-forming units/mL/day, as is encountered in patients. By day 7, resistance to both ethambutol and isoniazid had increased. Previous exposure to ethambutol halted isoniazid early bactericidal activity. Daily therapy, as opposed to more intermittent therapy, was associated with the least proportion of efflux-pump-driven resistance, consistent with a time-driven effect.

Mucosal lacerations may affect the rank order of susceptibility to HIV but cannot be assessed in humans.

The penetrability of rhesus macaque mucosae differed significantly, with rectal challenge requiring the least virus, followed by vaginal and then oral routes (P = .031, oral vs vaginal; P< .001 rectal vs vaginal). These findings imply that intrinsic mucosal properties are responsible for the differential mucosal permeability. The latter paralleled the rank order reported for humans, with relative risk estimates within the range of epidemiological human studies. To test whether inflammation facilitates virus transmission—as predicted from human studies—we established a macaque model of localized buccal inflammation. Systemic infection occurred across inflamed but not normal buccal mucosa.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion.

There were 38 children and 74 adolescents who were HBsAg positive, and serum hepatitis virus (HBV) DNA was obtained and tested from 31 and 34 of them, respectively. The a mutants were found in 7 (22.6%) of 31 HBV DNA-positive children and in 7 (0.10%) of 7234 children, the entire population that was surveyed in 2004. After the beginning of universal immunization, the very low prevalence of mutants has remained unchanged for 20 years. More a mutants were found in immunized than in nonimmunized HBV DNA-positive children aged 1-4 years old (31% vs 4%, P = .016) but not in those children aged 5-12 years old. Approximately 68% of immunized, mutant-infected children had carrier mothers. More a mutants emerged in children immunized with plasma-derived vaccines than in those immunized with recombinant vaccines (14 of 5166 vs 3 of 4970, respectively; P = .04).
