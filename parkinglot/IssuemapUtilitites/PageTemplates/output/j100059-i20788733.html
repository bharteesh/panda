Pollen germination experiments indicated that pollen damage by water and exposure to solar radiation is serious. In the persistent calyx that holds water within it, the temperature inside the calyx changed slower than in the calyx that had the water removed. After supplemental pollination, the seed number, seed set, and seed mass of fruits that had water removed from the calyx were reduced greatly in both years.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: We conclude that the change in floral orientation could enhance male and female fitness of A. luridus and is effectively adaptive to the alpine environments, indicating a strong selection by the combined pressure from various abiotic nonpollinator agents in shaping the floral traits of this alpine plant.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/20788745</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: Poplars and their hybrids are seen as important candidates for bioenergy initiatives.

The two plantations, both in eastern Canada, contain many different complex hybrid clones with components from exotic species, mostly P. nigra, P. trichocarpa, and P. maximowiczii.

Atripliceae s.s. started to diversify during the Early Miocene in Eurasia, separating into the Archiatriplex and the Atriplex clades. The former consists of eight species-poor, disjunct, and morphologically heterogeneous genera and is likely a relictual lineage. The Atriplex clade comprises the majority of species and evolved one C? lineage 14.1-10.5 Ma, which diversified rapidly worldwide. The C? Atriplex entered North America during the Middle/Late Miocene and spread to South America subsequently. Australia was colonized by two C? lineages both arriving during the Late Miocene. One of them diversified rapidly, giving rise to most Australian Atriplex species.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Atripliceae s.s. comprise Archiatriplex, Atriplex, Exomis, Extriplex, Grayia, Halimione, Holmbergia, Manochlamys, Proatriplex, and Stutzia.

Eight clades are recognized as tribes (Casselieae, Citharexyleae, Duranteae, Lantaneae, Neospartoneae trib. nov., Petreeae, Priveae, and Verbeneae). Two genera, Dipyrena and Rhaphithamnus, remain unplaced in these larger clades. Petreeae, which consist of Neotropical lianas, are sister to the rest of the family.
