Average species density was ?10% lower in burned fens 1 yr after the fire but ?4–8% higher for the next 4 yr. Burned fens exhibited greater evenness but not until 4 yr after the fire. Differences in community composition were detected between the two fen types, but species ranks were similar, and species neither were added to nor removed from the burned assemblages.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Burning of Darlingtonia fens has detectable, albeit modest, effects on serpentine communities. Because fens have little or no canopy cover, fire has little influence on light availability in this system. This relatively small resource change, combined with high soil moisture and well-developed underground organs of fen plants, produces a highly resilient assemblage.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27975354</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: Trees and shrubs tend to occupy different niches within and across ecosystems; therefore, traits related to their resource use and life history are expected to differ.

The influence of phylogenetic relationships was examined with a phylogenetic ANOVA and phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). A principal component analysis was conducted to determine whether trees and shrubs occupy different portions of multivariate trait space.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Key results: Wood density did not differ between shrubs and trees, but there were significant differences in vessel diameter, vessel density, theoretical conductivity, and as expected, height. In addition, relationships between vessel traits and wood density differed between growth forms. Trees showed coordination among vessel traits, wood density, and height, but in shrubs, wood density and vessel traits were independent. These results hold when phylogenetic relationships were considered. In the multivariate analyses, these differences translated as significantly different positions in multivariate trait space occupied by shrubs and trees.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Differences in trait integration between growth forms suggest that evolution of growth form in some lineages might be associated with the degree of trait interrelation.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27975345</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the Study: Post-anthesis functionality of persistent perianth parts has rarely been investigated, but available evidence suggests that perianth persistence may not always have an adaptive value.

By experimentally manipulating corolla persistence, presence of fruit predators, and pollination, I tested whether variation in ecological scenario led to concomitant variation in the sign and magnitude of the effects of corolla marcescence on fecundity.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Key Results: Persistent corollas were detrimental to fecundity when plants were exposed to larvae, but not when larvae were excluded. Pollination and herbivory had nonadditive effects on the fecundity consequences of corolla marcescence, the strongest detrimental effects of corolla persistence occurring for the "exposed to larvae + supplementary pollination" treatment combination.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: The hypothesis that ecological context is a major determinant of the fitness value of corolla marcescence was supported. In N. longispathus, corolla marcescence will be a maladaptive trait in situations in which pollinators and fruit predators are simultaneously abundant, but will be a neutral character in the absence of fruit predators, irrespective of pollinator service.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27975346</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: Microhabitat studies use varied statistical methods, some treating site occupancy as a dependent and others as an independent variable.

Lilies are mainly in high-PAR spots, often close to light saturation. By contrast, PAR in random spots was often near the lily light compensation point. Lilies were near Serenoa repens less than at random; otherwise, neighbor identity had no significant effect.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Predictive methods are more useful in this context than the hypothesis tests. Light availability plays a big role in lily presence, which may help to explain increases in flowering and emergence after fire and roller-chopping.</TD></TR></table>
