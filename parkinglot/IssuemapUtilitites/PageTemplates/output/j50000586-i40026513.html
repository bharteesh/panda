If the idea of hybridation of language is so pejorative, it is because of an essentialist representation of language, based on the romantic idea that a language, as a living being, can only be pure, without any admixture. In fact, this organicist discourse on language aims at concealing a political aim : giving an « objective » , or « natural » justification for state-building.</TD></TR></table>
