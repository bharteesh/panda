Previous attempts to clarify performance speeds had been made by Mersenne, Simpson, Mace, Purcell, Loulié and Quantz, but these were merely of a general nature and did not refer to a particular composition.

Playing through the concerto at first hand the reader will find Wright's tempos to be more extreme in both directions than might have been expected. His extensive foreword to the concerto contains Wright's criticism of performers of his day who indulged in excessive speed and visually showy performance.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Contemporary biographical accounts reveal Wright to have been innovative in other fields as well as music. In contrast to the declining interest shown by successive entries in Grove, he was in his day widely celebrated as an exceptionally gifted musician and an inspirational teacher.</TD></TR></table>
