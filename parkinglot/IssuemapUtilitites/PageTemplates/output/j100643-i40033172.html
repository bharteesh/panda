Another type involves the representation of imagined sound, as in Morin's Le naufrage d'Ulisse, where brief interjections of the storm interrupt the singer as if materializing from his narration of past events. Composers sometimes turned mimesis into diegesis as in Montéclair's Le dépit généreux, where a descending chromatic bass depicting the singer's urge to weep becomes his real weeping in the following aria, or in Bernier's L'amour vainqueur, where the instrumental interjections first represent the singer's attempts to burst into song, then represent actual singing when they turn into the ritornello of the following aria. More overtly theatrical interactions between singer and instruments can be found in Montéclair's Le retour de la paix, where the 'fight' between violins and singer is an allegory of war, and in Campra's Le Jaloux where the singer engages in a dramatic tête-à-tête with the violins, whose sound becomes a dramatic interlocutor for the singer throughout the entire piece.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40731309</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>In his musical treatise of 1279, Anonymous of St Emmeram describes the polyphonic technique of hocketing, created by the rapid alternation of tones and rests.

One is in the fifth rhythmic mode and the other is in the second. A comparison of them leads to the conclusion that the fifthmode version preceded the second-mode one. In addition, rhythmic errors in the fifth-mode version suggest that an even earlier model existed along the lines of Anonymous's first-mode example.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Ms.447, into which the flyleaf had been pasted, was confiscated by 18th-century revolutionaries from Cîteaux, south of Dijon. Its probable scribe is identified as Brother Berno, a Cistercian monk, not necessarily at Cîteaux. He may have been working in Paris, since one of the texts he copied is the 'Cañones super tabulas Parisienses'. Similarly, Anonymous of St Emmeram was probably connected with the University of Paris. That the hockets appear on the flyleaf of a book associated with Cistercians and possibly with Paris suggests that the 'College' of St Bernard in Paris could have been a home to the flyleaf. The dissemination of Cistercian learning and its association with polyphonic music and theory in the 13th century provide a context for these hockets that is worth further investigation.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40731308</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>An outline of the role of a court almoner in this period and its connections with courtly cultural activity is the point of departure for this article, which argues that Guillaume de Machaut's earliest known job as court almoner not only placed him centrally within the sphere of courtly cultural activity, but also had a distinct and lasting influence on his courtly love doctrine with regard to the importance of giving and the centrality of largesse.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>An outline of the role of a court almoner in this period and its connections with courtly cultural activity is the point of departure for this article, which argues that Guillaume de Machaut's earliest known job as court almoner not only placed him centrally within the sphere of courtly cultural activity, but also had a distinct and lasting influence on his courtly love doctrine with regard to the importance of giving and the centrality of largesse.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Two songs in Machaut's output arguably functioned as epitomized editations on the issue of largesse, expounded at greater length in Machaut's narrative dits. One of these songs, Donnez, signeurs (B26), while not mentioning largesse by name, shares the central ideas and verbal expressions attached to descriptions of Largesse in Machaut's longer narrative poems Le jugement dou roi de Navarre and John of Luxembourg in Confort d'ami. Together with its 'sister balade', Honte, paour (B25), it forms a paired mediation on giving and honour that expresses a credo rather fitting for an almoner-courtier, while also presenting the differentially gendered ramifications of these virtues for courtly men and women.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40731307</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Richard Beauchamp (1382-1439) was one of the greatest warrior-statesman of his generation and also a great patron of music.

It may even reflect the taste of an avid music patron, whose particular concern for musical provision was expressed so clearly in his testatory provision and during his lifetime. The chapel may therefore be seen as a permanent household chapel, set in stone and glass, as well as a space which allows the contemporary visitor a glimpse into Earl Richard's life and sensibilities.</TD></TR></table>
