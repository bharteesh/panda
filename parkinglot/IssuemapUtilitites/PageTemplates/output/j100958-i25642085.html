These latter processes appeared also responsible for the arrival of fresh litter material from Oi and Oe horizons into the Oa horizon of the stunted forest and for the consequent genesis of humic substances from a mix of old and fresh residues.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>From our findings there seems to exist a reciprocal influence of vegetation quality on the OM composition, and of OM decomposition on nutrition, as driven by the microclimatic conditions and physical processes, which in turn may contribute to keep the soil at an unstable developmental stage and limit the spruce growth.</TD></TR></table>
