Drug and device corporations use strategies such as making biased inferences, influencing scientists and physicians, marketing rather than informing the public, and lobbying to control their own industry regulations to create market advantage. Successful marketing leads to the increased use of costly profit-making drugs and procedures over cheaper, nonpatented therapies. Because resources are limited, the overuse of costly modalities contributes to expensive health care, which presents a challenge to universal coverage. The free market also fosters the proliferation of industries, such as tobacco, food, and chemicals, which externalize costs to maximize profits, seek to unduly influence research by paying experts and universities, and attempt to control the media and regulatory agencies. Most vulnerable to the cumulative harm of these tactics are children, the poor, the sick, and the least educated.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: The free market can harm health and health care. The corporate obligation to increase profits and ensure a return to shareholders affects public health. Such excesses of capitalism pose formidable challenges to social justice and public health.

The cohort was divided into derivation, validation, and testing samples and 4 different strategies were used to derive candidate logistic regression models for 1-year mortality. The final risk prediction model was selected based on discriminatory ability (as measured by the c-statistic) and a risk prediction score was derived using methods adopted from the Framingham Heart Study. Calibration of the predictive model was assessed graphically.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: The risk of death during the first year of dialysis therapy was 16.4% in the derivation sample. The final model had a c-statistic of 0.765, 0.763, and 0.756 in the derivation, validation, and testing samples, respectively.

We used multivariable generalized linear models to compare healthcare costs for patients who received no predialysis nephrology care during the year before dialysis initiation with those who received low-(1-3 nephrology visits), moderate-(4-6 visits), and high-intensity (> 6 visits) nephrology care during this time period.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: There were 8022 patients meeting inclusion criteria: 37% received no predialysis nephrology care, while 24% received low, 16% moderate, and 23% high-intensity predialysis nephrology care. During the year after dialysis initiation, patients in these groups spent an average of 52, 40, 31, and 27 days in the hospital (P < 0.001), respectively, and accounted for an average of $103,772, $96,390, $93,336, and $89,961 in total healthcare costs (P < 0.001), respectively. Greater intensity of predialysis nephrology care was associated with lower costs even among patients whose first predialysis nephrology visit was ?3 months before dialysis initiation. Patients with greater predialysis nephrology care also had lower mortality rates during the year after dialysis initiation (43%, 38%, 28%, and 25%, respectively, P < 0.001).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Greater intensity of predialysis nephrology care was associated with fewer hospital days and lower total healthcare costs during the year after dialysis initiation, even though patients survived longer.</TD></TR></table>
