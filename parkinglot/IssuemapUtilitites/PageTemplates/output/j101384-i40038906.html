Os sedimentos correspondentes ao período de 1905-97 anos foram datados pelo método do 210 Pb. Cinco zonas de palinomorfos de algas (IA-VA) baseadas em Botryococcus/Pediastrum+outras algas de água doce foram determinadas como correspondentes a cinco estágios ambientais da Laguna de Tramandai conectados a oscilações climáticas. O ultimo, V estágio, é caracterizado pelo aumento notável de algas marinhas e diminuição em algas de água doce. Um enriquecimento em algas marinhas foi causado pelo aumento de entrada de águas marinhas através do canal artificial de conexão da laguna com o oceano, construído em 1961. Os resultados obtidos sobre a distribuição de algas de clorofilas foram comparados com as medidas disponíveis em mudanças do nível de água da Laguna Mirim, situada relativamente próximo a Laguna Tramandai. Foram comparados também com as séries temporais do "Southern Oscillation índex" durante o século 20. As frequências de algas clorofilas de uma maneira geral indicam que os períodos mais úmidos-mais secos coincidem com as curvas de oscilação de precipitações pluviais, podendo também ser relacionados com a variabilidade anual do "Southern Oscillation Index."</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40863804</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Pleistocene carbonates of south Florida and islands of the Florida Keys are currently divided into five marine sequences designated, from oldest to youngest, the Q1–Q5 units.

Les cartes ainsi réalisées sont ensuite comparées à une classification des habitats sous-marins obtenue par le logiciel QTC View depuis les données d'un sondeur monofaisceau ainsi qu'à l'imagerie d'un sonar à balayage latéral. La carte de réflectivité issue du mutlifaisceau est très semblable à l'imagerie issue du sonar latéral, assez semblable à la classification obtenue par QTC View sur un des sites d'acquisition mais assez différente sur un second site. Des hypothèses sont proposées quant à l'origine de ces résultats.

The Louisiana coastal erosion problem is especially dire because it occurs on several fronts with the narrowing and overtopping of barrier islands and loss of back barrier bay and interior marshlands. Coastal restoration efforts in Louisiana depend on emplacement of sediment to build up barrier island and deltaic systems. Discovery of usable sediment is thus a vital factor in restoration efforts because up to 80% of some restoration project budgets can be allocated to exploration, exploitation, and emplacement of sediment. Because this cost is directly proportional to the distance of borrow sources from the project area, the cost-effectiveness of barrier island restoration and marsh creation depends on locating sufficient sediment volumes that are suitable for placement on beaches and dunes and for creating marshes.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Coastal restoration in Louisiana requires clean sands for beach and dune restoration, whereas mixed sediments are required to rebuild marshes.

It is thus imperative that a comprehensive sediment management plan be developed to systematically and efficiently identify and allocate suitable sediment resources. At present, coastal and barrier island restoration projects are included in regional planning efforts, and the restoration project is decided before sediment sources are considered. The new approach proposed here is based on planning projects around locations of dredgeable sedimentary deposits in order to optimize sediment resources. Centralization of voluminous historical geoscientific and oil and gas infrastructure data is being accommodated in a new data management system called the Louisiana Sand Resource Database (LASARD). Managing sediment resources more strategically optimizes regional planning strategies and reduces construction costs. The Louisiana Sediment Management Plan (LASMP) conceptualizes systematic planning and better coordination of essential components of the huge restoration and protection effort currently undertaken in Louisiana.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40863822</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>This paper deals with the subdivision of the LingDingYang Estuary of the Pearl River Estuary (South China at the South China Sea) using geostatistical methods.
