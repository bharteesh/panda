Biblical studies has been confronted with the same question concerning the apparent 'disorder' of certain texts of the Bible. In response to this, Biblical scholars developed a method of analysis of the text, 'rhetorical analysis', which involves the theorisation of rules of rhetorical composition of speech as used in the ancient Semitic world. These rules can be applied not only to the Bible, but also to the Qur'an and other sacred texts of Semitic antiquity.

These two modes of its presence are part of the internal dynamic of the Qur'an, and create a tension that is both part of its meaning, and the way it communicates its meaning. This contextual repositioning of the locutions from the stages of its revelation to the Prophet, and through him the Companions, guiding their lives throughout a range of circumstances under his leadership to their place in the mushaf, reveals emphases and resonances that generate multiple levels of meaning. These modes are as two lungs. To be fruitful, every encounter with the Qur'an benefits from an awareness of the breath supplied by each to experience the levels of meaning it generates. There is a contrapuntal relationship between them that contributes to the vitality and vibrancy of the language, serving to enhance the universalistic relevance of the lessons it teaches, while mediated through a single individual.

Besides commentary, naturally, in every taf sir of the Qur'an, Sura 19 has also benefited from separate, individual treatment. It has been the object of special attention by modern Western scholars, in particular those of comparative religion and of Christianity, whose attention has centred largely on the virtue and piety of Mary, on the miraculous nature of the birth of Jesus, on Jesus' ministry, and on how Jesus' time on Earth came to an end. In addition, Sura 19 is a favourite of the interfaith community. Given this sustained and multivectored scrutiny, it is remarkable how little analysis has been devoted to its lexicon.
