Mean BMI decreased from 28.0 kg/m (95% CI 27.2 to 28.8) in the teenage motherhood group to 26.8 kg/m (25.9 to 27.7) in the oldest motherhood group (?30 years). For men, the equivalent mean values were 28.5 kg/m (27.3 to 29.8) and 27.1 kg/m (26.7 to 27.6). Associations with adiposity, lipid measures and glycated haemoglobin were largely explained by childhood antecedents and adult social and lifestyle variables. Associations with BP remained robust to adjustment: systolic blood pressure remained highest in teenage parents (7.5 mmHg (1.0 to 13.9) difference in women and 8.6 mmHg (0.4 to 16.8) difference in men between the youngest and the oldest parenthood groups)</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Lifestyle factors, rather than the biological impact of pregnancy, explain the relationship between age at motherhood and CHD risk factors. Family-based lifestyle interventions targeted at young parents may improve their future CHD risk.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/20720896</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Objective: Ethnic minorities constitute a growing part of the Danish population but little is known about ethnic disparity in early life mortality in this population.

The liveborn were followed up for vital status to the age of 1 year. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate relative risks according to ethnic group. The main outcome measure was stillbirth and infant death.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Compared with the majority population, the relative risks of stillbirth were 1.28 (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.53) for Turkish, 1.62 (1.25 to 2.09) for Pakistani and 2.11 (1.60 to 2.77) for Somali women. The relative risks of infant mortality were 1.41 (1.22 to 1.63), 1.88 (1.53 to 2.30) and 1.39 (1.03 to 1.89) for children born to Turkish, Pakistani and Somali mothers respectively. The fetal and infant mortality in offspring of Lebanese and Former Yugoslavian women was not different from the mortality in the Danish group. The differences found were, in general, not attributable to ethnic differences in socioeconomic position. Turkish, Pakistani and Somali children had an excess relative risk of infant death due to congenital malformations and the risk of death from perinatal causes was increased among the Pakistani offspring.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion: Among the five largest ethnic minorities, the Turkish.

Participants agreed/disagreed with a number of statements about the characteristics of their household and food shopping environments, including access, prices and quality. Education was used to characterise socioeconomic position (SEP). Main outcome measures were whether or not participants consumed fruit or vegetables on a daily basis.

There were significant socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption (ORs of not consuming fruit and vegetables were 4.26 and 5.47 among the lowest-educated groups for fruit and vegetables, respectively); however, these were not explained by any household or food shopping environmental factors.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Improving access to FV in the household and food shopping environments will only make a small contribution to improving population consumption levels, and may only have a limited effect in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in their consumption.</TD></TR></table>
