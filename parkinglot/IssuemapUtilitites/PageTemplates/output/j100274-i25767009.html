These ICD-10 modifications differ in their number of codes, chapters, and subcategories. Specific conditions are present in some but not all of the modifications.

After adjusting for early discharge practices, the risk of mortality still declined through 2005 (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.78).

The network-specific performance rates for blacks and nonblacks were highly correlated (r = 0.67, P < 0.001), but 47% of blacks, versus 31% of nonblacks, received care from the third of networks with lowest quality. Physician-hospital networks with higher overall quality, or patients with higher socioeconomic status, were no less likely to exhibit black-white disparities.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>7</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: It is possible to measure, benchmark, and monitor the quality of minority care at the level of networks responsible for ambulatory care. Consequently, it should be easier to provide patients with information on network performance and to design policies that improve the quality of minority-serving providers.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25767022</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background: Disparities in healthcare coverage and access have a prominent place on the national health policy agenda.

Patient volumes shifted toward high-volume centers over time for all procedures (P <0.001), although at the end of the study period, low-volume centers still cared for one-quarter to one-third of patients undergoing each of the studied procedures. Most of the overall improvements in mortality were attributable to decreasing mortality within volume categories as opposed to the effects of care concentration.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Modest concentration into higher-volume centers has taken place over the past decade, but improvements within volume categories have driven most of the generalized decreases in mortality.
