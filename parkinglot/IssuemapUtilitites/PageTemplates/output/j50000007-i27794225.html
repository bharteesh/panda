To determine the protection afforded by hepatitis B vaccine, Alaska Native persons who had received plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine when they were >6 months of age were tested for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) 22 years later.

Sequential corneal isolates (n = 39) from 15 immunocompetent patients with RHK were assayed for acyclovir susceptibility and genotyped by analyzing the hypervariable regions of the HSV-1 genes US1 and US12. The thymidine kinase (TK) gene of each isolate was sequenced, and the proportion of acyclovir-resistant viruses within isolates was determined.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Uniform acyclovir-resistant or acyclovir-sensitive sequential isolates were identified in 4 and 2 patients, respectively. Notably, the acyclovir susceptibility of sequential isolates changed from acyclovir sensitive to acyclovir resistant (5 patients) or from acyclovir resistant to acyclovir sensitive (3 patients). The acyclovir-resistant phenotype of the isolates correlated with the patient's unresponsiveness to acyclovir therapy. Combined analyses of the TK gene and genotype of sequential isolates showed that acyclovir-sensitive isolates contained multiple acyclovir-resistant variants of the same virus and that an identical acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strain reappeared in the patient's cornea during RHK episodes.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. Corneal HSV-1 isolates are mixtures of acyclovir-sensitive and acyclovir-resistant viruses that share the same genotype but have different TK sequences. Recovery of the same acyclovir-resistant virus during consecutive herpetic keratitis episodes suggests that acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 establishes latency and reactivates intermittently to cause acyclovir-refractory RHK.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27794235</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background.

To overcome this obstacle, we developed a method with which to study Plasmodium liver stages by means of bioluminescent imaging (BLI) of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii.

Using BLI, we performed imaging of the Plasmodium liver stages of mice infected with PyLuc sporozoites and monitored parasite dissemination during blood-stage infection. Because PyLuc luciferase activity is proportional to the number of parasites, BLI can be used to quantify the effect of drugs on liver-stage development.

Clearance of encapsulated bacilli from the blood was rapid (>90% clearance within 5 min), with 75% of the bacteria being trapped in the liver. Competition experiments with purified capsule polyglutamate inhibited this interaction. At the septicemic phase of cutaneous infection with spores, the encapsulated bacilli were trapped in the vascular spaces of the liver and interacted closely with the liver endothelium in the sinusoids and terminal and portal veins. They often grow as microcolonies containing capsular material shed by the bacteria.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion. We show that, in addition to its inhibitory effect on the interaction with the immune system, the capsule surrounding B. anthracis plays an active role in mediating the trapping of the bacteria within the liver and may thus contribute to anthrax pathogenesis. Because other microorganisms produce polyglutamate, it may also represent a general mechanism of virulence or in vivo survival.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27794238</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background.
