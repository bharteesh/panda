Partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA) revealed two strong canonical axes, one related to litter/light and another to cover of Quercus spp. versus J. virginiana.

Apparently, when soil moisture was sufficient, the main factor limiting C. canescens' establishment was competition, while in the dry year, water became the limiting factor. Survival rates were not affected by disturbance. In humid years, C. canescens emerged in higher numbers in open successional stages while in the dry year, emergence rates were higher in late stages, suggesting an important role of late successional stages for the persistence of C.canescens.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Our results suggest that small-scale disturbances can promote germination of C. canescens. However, disturbances should be carefully planned. The optimal strategy for promoting C.canescens is to apply disturbances just before seed dispersal and not during dry years. At the landscape scale, a mosaic of different vegetation types is beneficial for the protected pioneer grass as facilitation by late-successional species may be an important mechanism for the persistence of C. canescens, especially in dry years.</TD></TR></table>
