Referents were 130 non-poisoned workers randomly selected from company payrolls. Psychological distress symptoms during the month prior to interview were obtained using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), which has a general severity index and nine subscale scores.

Long-term monitoring detects trends over several years by various exposure characteristics (place, staff, procedure, etc) through estimating rates of change and using the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) to prevent artefactual trends due to the many categories for each characteristic.

Long-term monitoring identified moderate trends over time. The BLUP corrected the estimate of each specific annual rate of change and allowed all other rates to reduce the random variability around the mean change for more specificity. League tables showed significant increases or decreases compared to no change. League tables for two-by-two comparisons allowed reliable comparisons between estimates of the rates of change, although with spurious ranking.

Significant determinants of the two modes of return to work were different. A test of the equality of ORs indicated that the relative ORs for the difference in the slope coefficients for five of the 10 independent factors in the two polytomous logistic regression sub-models corresponding to each mode of return to work were statistically significant.
