The company maintains a single distribution center in which it receives products from suppliers, and processes and packs them for shipping to stores across the United States. The volumes of particular products and the number of different products shipped in a week have significant week-to-week volatility. Short lead times are typical because of supplier manufacturing delays and strict in-store due-date requirements. At the distribution center, processing and packing are scheduled through multiple processing departments that compete for use of shared merge conveyors and shared sortation systems. Blockbuster's general processing and packing goal is on-time delivery of products to stores while controlling costs.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Blockbuster Inc., a chain of VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, and video game rental stores, has developed a highly specialized distribution network.

Implemented beginning in January 2007, the model has helped Blockbuster to maintain timely shipping, reduce related labor and transportation costs, improve capacity utilization, and attain a better understanding of how to achieve further improvements. Blockbuster's structure, in which multiple processing departments compete for subsequent shared resources, such as merge conveyors and sortation systems, is common in other industries; therefore, we also discuss the relevance of this model to other organizations.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41318831</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>To improve coverage against vaccine-preventable diseases for children and adults, and to aid caretakers and providers in making appropriate and timely vaccination decisions, Georgia Institute of Technology collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop decision support tools for creating optimized catch-up immunization schedules for four target groups: children through age 6, adolescents ages 7 through 18, adults ages 19 and over in the United States, and children and adolescents through age 19 in Canada.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>To improve coverage against vaccine-preventable diseases for children and adults, and to aid caretakers and providers in making appropriate and timely vaccination decisions, Georgia Institute of Technology collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop decision support tools for creating optimized catch-up immunization schedules for four target groups: children through age 6, adolescents ages 7 through 18, adults ages 19 and over in the United States, and children and adolescents through age 19 in Canada.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Our solution to the catch-up scheduling problem for each targeted group determines the best coverage schedule for each individual given his (her) vaccination history and age. If an individual misses one or more doses of a recommended vaccine, a health-care professional is typically responsible for generating a feasible catch-up schedule that optimizes the person's coverage against vaccine-preventable diseases, a task that is often challenging and time consuming.
