A geodatabase was created considering hundreds of data points (wells, springs, rivers, lagoons, and seas) and monthly time series of rainfall, temperature, and river discharge. Monitoring activity was realised over a hydrological year, installing a rainfall network tool and using a network of tens of sampling points, including springs, wells, lagoons, and sea. Chemical—physical and stable isotope determinations were realised.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Two main groups of aerial springs are fed by the aquifer, one of which is of a coastal type. The total spring discharge is roughly 4 m³/s. The submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) was assessed as being equal to 1.4 m³/s on the basis of the current rate of anthropic discharge and climatic conditions. The study showed the peculiarities of this carbonate coastal aquifer and the importance of its groundwater, which is the chief water source for the third-largest Albanian town. The groundwater quality was generally high, mainly due to the negligible presence of contamination sources on the relief in which the aquifer outcrops. The rate of seawater intrusion effects was also low, thanks to favourable aquifer three-dimensional geometry and high recharge levels.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>The increasing anthropic activities constitute a relevant risk in the absence of the introduction of rigorous land and water management criteria.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25790512</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Hydrodynamic and pollutant transport models are useful tools for evaluating remediation options for polluted water bodies.

Here, the Vjose River is the dominant source of sediment for the continental shelf. We provided evidences that the (Vjose River) sediment distribution is under the control of a complex, local circulation pattern that is defined by the peculiar regional shape of the gulf which is tectonically controlled. The tectonic control on the present-day, sedimentary processes is also evident offshore from the Karaburun Peninsula, along the upper slope, where important resedimentation processes have been recognized and are related to the recent geodynamic evolution of the margin.</TD></TR></table>
