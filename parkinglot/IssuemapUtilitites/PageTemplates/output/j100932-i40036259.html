Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine differences between flow parameters in dammed and nondammed rivers. We used correlation analyses and generalized linear model comparisons to examine associations of flow parameters and canopy cover of native (Populus and Salix) and non-native (Tamarix and Elaeagnus) taxa.

River regulation does not necessarily increase the cover of non-native, invasive species.

We then examined the distributions of these significantly deviating pairs with respect to phylogenetic relatedness and ecological differentiation, and compared these patterns with those predicted by the six community assembly models. We used permutation regression to test whether co-occurrence patterns are predictedby relatedness, body size difference or difference in diet quality.

This is consistent with assemblage structuring by competition, but may also result from low geographic overlap of species pairs, which contributes to negative co-occurrences at the archipelago-wide level. Distributions of species pairs within plots of phylogenetic distance x ecological differentiation were consistent with competition, habitat filtering or within-island speciation models, depending on the taxon.

At the northern limit, although a sperm donor species is present further north, suitable environmental conditions are absent from nearby locations. At the southern limit, a sperm donor species is present and areas with good environmental conditions are present at nearby locations, suggesting that dispersal ability is the limiting factor. We found that the hybrid species overlaps in a similar way with both parental species while still having its own niche identity. This result may be explained by the fact that hybrid species inherit characteristics of two ecologically divergent species, which can result in intermediate or even transgressive phenotypes. These results support recent work on the role of hybridization in diversification.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801848</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To test historical and current influences on the distributions of sympatric colour morphotypes in the coral reef fish genus Hypoplectrus.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To test historical and current influences on the distributions of sympatric colour morphotypes in the coral reef fish genus Hypoplectrus.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Location: The Caribbean and surrounding tropical waters.

There is also little evidence to suggest past or current geographical isolation, with only one of the 11 morphotypes (Hypoplectrus chlorurus) showing a density distribution that is consistent with the population centre hypothesis.

Current distributions are likely to be driven by competitive interactions and/or habitat preferences. Our study highlights the value of the Hypoplectrus species complex as a system for the study of speciation in the marine environment, and implies that these closely related morphotypes have ecological relevance rather than being simple colour variants of a single polymorphic species.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801857</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To establish the extent to which archipelagos follow the same species-area relationship as their constituent islands and to explore the factors that may explain departures from the relationship.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To establish the extent to which archipelagos follow the same species-area relationship as their constituent islands and to explore the factors that may explain departures from the relationship.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Location: Thirty-eight archipelagos distributed worldwide.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: We used ninety-seven published datasets to create island species-area relationships (ISARs) using the Arrhenius logarithmic form of the power model. Observed and predicted species richness of an archipelago and of each of its islands were used to calculate two indices that determined whether the archipelago followed the ISAR. Archipelagic residuals (ArcRes) were calculated as the residual of the prediction provided by the ISAR using the total area of the archipelago, standardized by the total richness observed in the archipelago. We also tested whether any characteristic of the archipelago (geological origin and isolation) and/or taxon accounts for whether an archipelago fits into the ISAR or not.

Exceptions arose for archipelagos where (i) the slopes of the ISAR are low, (ii) observed species richness is higher than expected by the ISAR and/or (iii) distance to the mainland is small. The archipelago's geological origin was also important; a higher percentage of oceanic archipelagos fit into their ISAR than continental ones. ArcRes indicated that the ISAR underpredicts archipelagic richness in the least isolated archipelagos. Different types of taxon showed no differences in ArcRes. Nestedness and ArcRes appear to be related, although the form of the relationship varies between metrics.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: Archipelagos, as a rule, follow the same ISAR as their constituent islands.

Elevational reptile richness was most strongly correlated with temperature. The temperature effect was mediated by precipitation; reptile richness was more strongly tied to temperature on wet gradients than on arid gradients.

But the influence of precipitation on the temperature effect most likely reflects reptiles' use of radiant heat sources (sunning opportunities) that are more widespread on arid mountains than wet mountains due to lower humidity, sparser vegetation and less cloud cover across low and intermediate elevations.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40801853</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: Ecogeographical variation of body size in vertebrates (e. g.

The best Akaike information criterion (AIC) models showed that populations with larger body size are associated with cold climates and secondarily with high primary productivity.

Thus, our study suggests that biases in the anthropogenic mechanisms involved in transporting species around the globe are surprisingly consistent across broadly divergent taxa.</TD></TR></table>
