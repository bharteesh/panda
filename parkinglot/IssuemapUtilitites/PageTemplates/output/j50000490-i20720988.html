In the intervention arm, GPs were visited to facilitate quality enhancements of the screening programme, combined with a special targeted invitation to women aged 23-59 registered with the GP but not attending screening for the last 5 years.

The associations were as follows: MDD and low education odds ratio (OR) 2.38 (CI 95% 1.68 to 3.37), MDD and non-employment OR 11.67 (CI 95% 8.06 to 16.89), MDD and low income OR 9.78 (CI 95% 6.49 to 14.74). Education only explained a minor part of the association between non-employment and depressive disorders and no associations were found between education and prescription.

Severe socioeconomic consequences of depression are indicated by the fact that the associations with non-employment and low income were much stronger than the association with low education.</TD></TR></table>
