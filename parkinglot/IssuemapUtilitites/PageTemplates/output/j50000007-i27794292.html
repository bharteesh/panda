The messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 demonstrated the greatest increases among chemokines in brain specimens of infected mice, as determined by microarray. CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA accumulation was interferon (IFN)-?–dependent. Expression of CXCL10 was predominantly observed in astrocytes. Weight loss was registered in wild-type but not in CXCL10 and CXCR3 infected mice. Infected CXCL10 or CXCR3 mice demonstrated reduced accumulation of trypanosomes and T cells in the brain parenchyma but similar parasitemia levels, compared with wild-type mice. CXCL10 and IFN-? levels were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with late stage but not early stage human African trypanosomiasis. Levels of CXCL10 in patients with late stage human African trypanosomiasis were associated with somnolence, low body weight, and trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion. IFN-?–dependent CXCL10 is critical for accumulation of T cells and trypanosomes in the brain during experimental African trypanosomiasis.

Using 53 clinical and geographically diverse US E. faecium isolates dating from 1971 to 1994, we determined the multilocus sequence type; the presence of 16 putative virulence genes (hyl, esp, and fms genes); resistance to ampicillin (AMP) and vancomycin (VAN); and high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Overall, 16 different sequence types (STs), mostly CC17 isolates, were identified in 9 different regions of the United States. The earliest CC17 isolates were part of an outbreak that occurred in 1982 in Richmond, Virginia. The characteristics of CC17 isolates included increases in resistance to AMP, the presence of hyl and esp, emergence of resistance to VAN, and the presence of at least 13 of 14 fms genes. Eight of 41 of the early isolates with resistance to AMP, however, were not in CC17.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions. Although not all early US AMP isolates were clonally related, E. faecium CC17 isolates have been circulating in the United States since at least 1982 and appear to have progressively acquired additional virulence and antibiotic resistance determinants, perhaps explaining the recent success of this species in the hospital environment.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27794307</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background.

Multiple strategies were used to investigate a new surface protein that has the potential to be a protective antigen.

We identified an enolase gene from SS2 and systematically characterized its protein product, enolase. Biophysical data indicated that S. suis enolase is an octameric protein. Enzymatic assays verified its ability to catalyze the dehydration of 2-phospho-D-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. In consideration of the strong antigenicity of enolase, an efficient enolase-based method was established for monitoring SS2 infections. Combined evidence strongly indicated that SS2 enolase can localize on the bacterial cell surface and facilitate bacterial adherence. Additionally, we found that enolase can confer complete protection against SS2 infection to mice, which suggests that enolase has potential as a vaccine candidate.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions.

We prospectively recruited children with CM (n = 240), SA (n = 101), and uncomplicated malaria (UM) (n = 42) in Bamako, Mali, and measured IL-4 production in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We then assessed the influence of 11 polymorphisms on predisposition to SM by the family-based association test (FBAT).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. IL-4 concentrations were higher in children with CM than in children with UM during malaria (P = .003).

A follow-up study was conducted for the Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of Infants trial in Blantyre, Malawi (PEPI-Malawi). In PEPI-Malawi, breast-feeding infants of HIV-infected women were randomized at birth to receive a either control regimen (single-dose nevirapine plus 1 week of zidovudine); the control regimen plus nevirapine to age 14 weeks; or the control regimen plus nevirapine and zidovudine to age 14 weeks. Infant HIV infection, maternal CD4 cell count, and HAART use were determined. Maternal HAART use was categorized as HAART eligible but untreated (CD4 cell count of <250 cells/?L, no HAART received), HAART eligible and treated (CD4 cell count of <250 cells/?L, HAART received), and HAART ineligible (CD4 cell count of ?250 cells/?L). The incidence of HIV infection and the association between postnatal HIV transmission and maternal HAART were calculated among infants who were HIV negative at 14 weeks.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Of 2318 infants, 130 (5.6%) acquired HIV infection, and 310 mothers (13.4%) received HAART. The rates of HIV transmission (in cases per 100 person-years) were as follows: for the HAART-eligible/untreated category, 10.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.91–13.82); for the HAART-eligible/treated category, 1.79 (95% CI, 0.58–4.18); and for the HAART-ineligible category, 3.66 (95% CI, 2.86–4.61). The HIV transmission rate ratio for the HAART-eligible/treated category versus the HAART-eligible/untreated category, adjusted for infant prophylaxis, was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.07–0.44).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions.

Cell-free hemoglobin (a potent NO quencher), reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) (a measure of endothelial NO bioavailability), and measures of perfusion and endothelial activation were quantified in adults with moderately severe (n = 78) or severe (n = 49) malaria and control subjects (n = 16) from Papua, Indonesia.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results.

Multivariable regression analysis revealed that cell-free hemoglobin remained inversely associated with RH-PAT, and in patients with SM, there was a significant longitudinal association between improvement in RH-PAT index and decreasing levels of cell-free hemoglobin (P = .047).

For gametocyte-specific detection, the microscopy prevalence was, on average, 8.7% (95% CI, 2.8%–26.6%) of the prevalence measured by PCR.
