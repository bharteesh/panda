The presence of a working partner marginally buffered the effects. In dual-earner couples, mothers reported anxiety symptoms less often than women without children. Few women were home-makers (5.8%). The odds of poor self-rated health and fatigue increased with increasing number of children in employed women, and in women working 40 h or more. Poor self-rated health was also associated with the number of children in students. Many mothers wished to reduce their working hours, suggesting time stress was a factor in their impaired health. The associations between having children and health symptoms were not exclusively attributed to having young children.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Having children may contribute to fatigue and poor self-rated health particularly in women working 40 h or more per week.

Also countries aiming for economic and gender equality should consider factors that may facilitate successful merging of work and family life.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27797641</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Objectives: To examine the association between paternal occupational exposures and retinoblastoma using birth registration data for cases from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours (NRCT) and controls from the general population of Great Britain.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Objectives: To examine the association between paternal occupational exposures and retinoblastoma using birth registration data for cases from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours (NRCT) and controls from the general population of Great Britain.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: A case–control study of paternal occupational data for 1318 cases of retinoblastoma, born and diagnosed in Great Britain between 1962 and 1999, and 1318 controls matched on sex, date of birth and birth registration sub-district.
