Poisson regression models were adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, cohort, calendar year, and use of other antiretroviral drugs and assessed the association between MI risk and cumulative (per year) or recent (current or in the past 6 months) use of antiretroviral drugs, with >30,000 person-years of exposure.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. Over 178,835 person-years, 580 patients developed MI. There were no associations between use of tenofovir, zalcitabine, zidovudine, stavudine, or lamivudine and MI risk. Recent exposure to abacavir or didanosine was associated with an increased risk of MI. No association was found between MI risk and cumulative exposure to nevirapine, efavirenz, nelfinavir, or saquinavir. Cumulative exposure to indinavir and lopinavir-ritonavir was associated with an increased risk of MI (relative rate [RR] per year, 1.12 and 1.13, respectively). These increased risks were attenuated slightly (RR per year, 1.08 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.02–1.14] and 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01–1.17], respectively) after adjustment for lipids but were not altered further after adjustment for other metabolic parameters.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions.

We assayed cytokines and their messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in culture supernatants of human macrophages infected with H5N1, S-OIV California/04/2009 (S-OIV-CA), S-OIV Hong Kong/415742 (S-OIV-HK), or seasonal H1N1 with or without celecoxib and mesalazine.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results.

No major cytokine storm, as seen in H5N1 infection, is associated with S-OIV infection of cell lines.

Drug use approximated 1 treatment per person-year and was associated with increasing frequencies of pfcrt and pfmdr 1 mutations and of treatment failure.

A total of 33 participants were enrolled in each group. Demographic characteristics were comparable. No vaccine-related serious adverse event was reported. The most common systemic reactions were headache, malaise, and myalgia. Low viremia levels were detected, mainly of serotype 4. Immune response increased with successive vaccine doses. All participants seroconverted against all 4 serotypes after receiving 3 doses at 0, 4, and 12–15-months, and almost all seroconverted after 2 doses given 8–11 months apart.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions.
