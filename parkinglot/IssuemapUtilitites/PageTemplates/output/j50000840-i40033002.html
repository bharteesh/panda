Firstly, Romer's theory, which approaches a country's level of development by using the number of its products (Romer 1990), secondly, Jones' idea theory with a slight modification (Jones 2004), third, the theory of quality of institutions, which determines economic performance (North 1993), and finally, the theory of physical and human capital. The first part of the paper sets up the production function, the second determines the growth rate and analyses the reconstruction path, while the third draws up model forecasts.</TD></TR></table>
