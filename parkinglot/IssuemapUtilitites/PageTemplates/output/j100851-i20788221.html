Primary organic markers included PM primary organic carbon, and PM polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and hopanes. Secondary organic markers included PM secondary organic carbon, and PM water soluble organic carbon and n-alkanoic acids. Gaseous pollutants included carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NO; combustion emissions markers), and ozone (O?; photochemistry marker).

Mortality increased with increasing level and duration of aircraft noise. The adjusted hazard ratio comparing ?60 dB(A) with <45 dB(A) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval = 0.96-1.7) overall, and 1.5 (1.0-2.2) in persons who had lived at the same place for at least 15 years.

The corrected variance increases with increasing correlation, depending on the number of control person-moments. The first illustration shows that the rate ratio (RR) of cardiac death associated with ?-agonist use, not estimable with 1 control per case (30 cases) and 1 control person-moment, was 4.2 (95% confidence interval = 0.4-49) with 12 control person-moments. The second example finds a rate ratio of acute myocardial infarction associated with antibiotics of 2.00 (1.16-3.44) with 1 control per case, which improves in precision with 10 control subjects per case (RR = 2.13 [1.48-3.05]) but also with 1 control per case and 10 control person-moments per control subject (1.99 [1.36-2.90]).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion: When dealing with time-varying exposures, the multitime case-control design can increase the efficiency of conventional case-control studies without additional control subjects.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/20788240</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background: The Demographic and Health Survey program routinely collects nationally representative information on HIV-related risk behaviors in many countries, using face-to-face interviews and a complex sampling scheme.
