The first, peak, and last flowering dates of E. grandiflorum advanced an average of 3.2 d/decade.

The spatial structure of stand-level and individual-level features was estimated with spatial analyses (pair-correlation function and nearest-neighbor distances).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Key Results: Multistemmed trees were merged clusters of separate individuals. Merged trees were predominantly found at the edge of the second-growth forests. We found strong clustering (?5 m) at forest edge sites and none at interior sites. Nearest-neighbor distance distributions were unimodal for unmerged trees and monotonically decreasing for merged trees; interstem distances were much smaller at the edge sites than at the interior sites.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: The occurrence of merged trees at the forest edge, and the resulting high spatial aggregation of stems, is consistent with the hypothesis that establishment was probably aggregated. The spatial pattern found at the forest edge changes the standard spatial pattern sequence through time in temperate forests, altering traditional forest-stand-dynamics models.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27857375</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: Habitat fragmentation is often assumed to result in limited genetic diversity across impacted plant communities.

Horticultural samples all shared one genotype, which can be traced back to a single natural population.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Clonal reproduction is an important factor in the maintenance of natural populations of I. parviflorum, although the degree to which this is true varies by population. Horticultural samples likely represent a single or very few collection events, indicating the need for greater genetic diversity within horticultural stocks. Further analyses using microsatellites are planned to confirm these results.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27857362</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: Plant movement is more widespread than often recognized, involving different organs and mechanisms.

The opening mechanism is based on an antagonistic reaction between a nonlignified swelling tissue and a lignified resistance tissue.
