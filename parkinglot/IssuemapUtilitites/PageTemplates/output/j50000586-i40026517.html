The analysis of these particuhr clauses, conducted in a text linguistic perspective of information structuring, includes : 1 / the syntactic constraints on these constructions ; 2 / the evolution of this type of construction under the double pression of literacy (which involves a kind of synthetism) and the influence of the (more analytic) neighboring Indo-European modeh.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40605128</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Whatever the studied language, the communicational needs result in distinguishing several types of sentences diffenng syntactically by the nature of their head.
