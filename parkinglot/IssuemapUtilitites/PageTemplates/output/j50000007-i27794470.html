To investigate factors associated with cutaneous HPV seropositivity, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 411 patients undergoing routine skin cancer screening examinations. Serum antibodies were measured and evaluated for 36 cutaneous HPV types in the genera alpha, beta, gamma, mu, and nu. Associations of demographic and lifestyle factors with cutaneous HPV seropositivity were estimated using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals calculated using logistic regression.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results. The seroprevalence of ?1 cutaneous HPV type was 96% and 90% for men and women, respectively.

Independent associations of demographic and skin cancer risk factors with genus-specific HPV seropositivity differed by sex.
