Cases were validated by manual review and compared with age- and sex-matched controls (n = 9993).

An increased risk of pneumonia was evident only in the first 12 months of treatment with proton pump inhibitors. There was some evidence of a dose response. Among patients taking proton pump inhibitors for less than 1 year, the risk of community-acquired pneumonia was stronger when current use was for dyspepsia or peptic ulcer (1.73 [1.29–2.34]) than for gastroesophageal reflux disease or prevention of upper gastrointestinal injury associated with aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (1.22 [0.97–1.52]).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: We observed a small increase in the risk of community-acquired pneumonia associated with current proton pump inhibitor use, particularly during the first 12 months of treatment and at higher doses.

This OR increased to above 3.0 when urinary arsenobetaine was added to the logistic risk model. However, this high OR was a statistical artifact because arsenobetaine, which is ingested from fish and is essentially nontoxic, is a part of measured total urinary arsenic. These 2 variables are highly correlated (correlation = 0.80). Because arsenobetaine is a part of total arsenic, it should first be subtracted from total arsenic rather than being added to the statistical model.
