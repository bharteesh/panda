The approaches were developed through analysis of a dataset recording the Apparent Density of Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina tachinoides (Diptera: Glossinidae) in three riparian sites in Burkina Faso over 15 months between 2006 and 2007. This site is fragmented due to human activity in the area.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>The first approach, Space Time Ordinary Kriging, does not consider the effect of fragmentation. It is used as a benchmark to test the increased explanatory power of the second method, which does account for fragmentation. The second method, Regression Space Time Simple Kriging, is a distinct improvement over the first approach because it allows for a spatial trend in the mean trap catch; this trend is related to, and later predicted from, environmental co-variates.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>The results indicate the presence of space and time effects on tsetse distribution, dependent on the size of the habitat fragmentation patches. These effects occur at relatively small geographic scales within a season. Whilst such variation has long been suspected, the new methods presented here are able to quantify this variation precisely, so that seasonal and spatial comparisons can now be made both within and between species.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40925371</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Understanding patterns of species richness at broad geographic extents remains one of the most challenging yet necessary scientific goals of our time.

Although environmental predictors are highly redundant, energy and seasonality explain different and complementary fractions of variation in species richness of all bats. On the other hand, heterogeneity variables contribute little to explain this gradient. However, results change dramatically when richness is estimated for groups of species with different sizes of geographic distribution. First, the amount of variation explained by environment decreases with a decrease in range size; this suggests that richness gradients of small-ranged species can not be explained as easily as those of broadly distributed species, as has been implied by analyses that do not consider differences in range size among species. Second, the relative contribution of environmental predictors to explained variation also changes with change in range size. Seasonality and energy are good predictors of species with broad distributions, but they loose almost all explanatory power for richness of species with small ranges. In contrast, heterogeneity, which is a relatively poor predictor of richness of species with large ranges, becomes the main predictor of richness gradients of species with restricted distributions. This suggests that range size is a different dimension on which heterogeneity and other environmental characteristics are complementary to each other. Our results suggest that determinants of species richness gradients might be complex, or at least more complex than many studies have previously suggested.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/40925359</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Species with extensive geographic ranges may interact with different species assemblages at distant locations, with the result that the nature of the interactions may vary spatially.

Assemblages closer together were more similar; such correlations approximately doubled when including only on-or off-colony grids. Black-tailed prairie dogs had a significant effect on associated rodent assemblages that varied regionally, dependent upon the composition of the local rodent species pool. Over the range of the black-tailed prairie dog, on-colony rodent richness and evenness were less variable, and species composition was more consistent than offcolony assemblages.</TD></TR></table>
