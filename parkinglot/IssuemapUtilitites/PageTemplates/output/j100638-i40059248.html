Future tree cover change was analysed with generalized additive models (GAMs). We used climate data from 17 general circulation models (GCMs) and included human population density and fire intensity to model tree cover.

However, uncertainty due to different GCMs was particularly high for the grassland and the evergreen biome shift. Increasing tree cover (1-10%) was projected for large parts of Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo, but a decrease was projected for coastal areas (1—20%).

Population divergence began prior to the Holocene interglacial. Stable population sizes over time indicate a lack of demonstrable demographic response to climatic changes during the last glacial period. This study highlights the importance of topographic complexity in promoting within-island vicariant speciation in the Greater Antilles, and indicates long-term persistence and lineage diversification despite late Pleistocene climatic oscillations.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41310584</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: A positive power relationship between maximal body mass and land area has previously been reported of the form M

Molecular dating approaches converge on a stem age of c. 38 Ma for Tildenia and a mostly Miocene diversification and colonization.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: We detect a strong correlation between diversification of Tildenia and orogenetic events in the respective distribution centres. In the Andes, distribution was influenced by the Altiplano-Eastern Cordillera System as well as the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone, where the latter serves as both migration barrier and migration bridge for different clades. In contrast to most studies of highelevation taxa, we provide support for a south-north colonization towards Central America and Mexico, and provide additional, independent evidence for the latest view on the timing of the Great American Biotic Interchange. In Mexico, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt has played a major role in more recent radiations together with climatic oscillation and the formation of réfugia.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41310592</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: We examine a presence-absence matrix of the avifauna of the Bismarck Archipelago, for which the concept of competitively driven community assembly rules was formulated, to determine whether data support widespread competitive determination of geographical distributions.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: We examine a presence-absence matrix of the avifauna of the Bismarck Archipelago, for which the concept of competitively driven community assembly rules was formulated, to determine whether data support widespread competitive determination of geographical distributions.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Location: Bismarck Archipelago.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: We obtained occurrences of 154 land and freshwater bird species on 31 islands.

For many checkerboard pairs, species are not widely interspersed but are regionally allopatric, which probably reflects historical biogeography and dispersal limitation. Most congeneric and intraguild checkerboards include a species classified as a supertramp; when supertramps are omitted, there are 11 congeneric checkerboards and four intraguild but heterogeneric checkerboards.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: In isolation, presence-absence matrices provide limited insight into the role of competition in structuring bird communities of the Bismarcks. A major problem is disentangling historical geography and colonization history of the archipelago from the present-day ecology of the species. Examination of observed checkerboards from a geographically explicit perspective and with knowledge of colonization routes suggests that many checkerboards are likely to result, at least in part, from historical biogeography and supertramps. Although species may be forced into supertramp status by competition, other factors (e.g. habitat preference) may be causal, and biogeographical distributions alone cannot distinguish between causes.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41310591</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: The causes of a Zoogeographic divide in peninsular Thailand around the Isthmus of Kra have not been adequately resolved.

We studied bats (order Chiroptera) because of their ability to bypass small-scale geophysical barriers. Spatial data on bat species distributions on the Thai Peninsula were analysed in relation to multivariate measures of climate to determine the possible influence of climatic zonation on distribution patterns. We assessed the effects of the interaction of climatic zonation with the highly dynamic environmental conditions the area has undergone in relation to species distribution patterns.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: A Zoogeographie transition was found, with 44 species (out of 127) restricted to the north of the Isthmus of Kra and 29 restricted to the south, although there were relatively few abrupt changes in distribution at the exact position of the isthmus. Northern and southern species were associated with specific climatic conditions. Major transitions in the distribution of bat species exist at 6-6.5° N and 13-13.5° N, with a smaller peak at 11.0° N. These major peaks fall in the same areas as the borders of climatic zones, and the 6-6.5° N peak falls in the same area as a floristic divide (the Kangar-Pattani Line).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: On the mainland, climatic zones cause gradual changes in species distributions. However, in addition to climatic factors, repeated changes in the breadth of the Sunda Shelf during recent glacial cycles may have caused locally high extinction rates at narrow points on the peninsula, exacerbating transitions in species distribution patterns along the region, in the context of a peninsula effect that reduces opportunities for recolonization.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41310593</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To examine the roles of physical and biotic environment, distance, direction and dispersal in determining the composition of plant communities at a regional scale.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: To examine the roles of physical and biotic environment, distance, direction and dispersal in determining the composition of plant communities at a regional scale.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Location: Grassland and shrubland at 266 sites in the mountains of southern South Island, New Zealand.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Methods: Species abundances of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens were measured by height-frequency. Predictors were soils, climate, mammal grazing, physical distance and direction between plots, and geological history represented by occurrence on the same or different mountain ranges. Relationships were evaluated with quadratic multiple regression and Mantel tests.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results: Spatial autocorrelation was present for both vascular and lower plants. However, distance explained only a minor part of the variation. Distance relationships were anisotropic, with the vegetation differences being greatest in the direction of the prevailing south-westerly wind. Even using all the environmental information, much of the species composition remained unexplained. For species presence, distance alone explained 7% of the variation, environment alone 25% and both together 28%. The abundance of species was even less predictable: distance 2%, environment 11% and both 12%. With vascular species, climate-related factors contributed the most to prediction, especially altitude. Surprisingly, soil chemical factors were more important for lower plants that are not rooted in the substrate. Species likely to disperse further showed a tendency towards weaker distance differentiation. Vegetation composition seemed unrelated to contemporary grazing, although historical grazing/burning may have been causal. There was little evidence for a relationship of species composition with biogeographic/geological history.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Main conclusions: Difference in community composition in these grasslands is only weakly related to distance, and only half of the distance effect can be explained by the environmental factors measured. Dispersal and geological history do not seem to explain the discrepancy. Explicability of community differences was comparable to that in some previous case studies, although weaker than that in others, but all of the previous studies examined only part of the flora, such as 'abundant trees' or palms - none examined even all the vascular species. The species complement of a site seems more conservative than the abundance of the species, much of which was not explicable from current information and may reflect past management history.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41310590</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Aim: We evaluated the hypothesis that, given niche conservatism, relatedness of co-occurring hummingbird species of a given clade will increase at greater distances from the elevation where it originated.
