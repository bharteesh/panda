Usually the biological performance of a wetland depends on improvement of the physical parameters, such as tidal flushing, water quality, freshwater flow reduction, and channel and basin sedimentation. Other factors that should be taken into consideration are the impacts of the wetland on adjacent beaches, the response of the wetland to dry and wet periods, any possible or expected future climate changes, and biodiversity management.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>This paper discusses cases of environmental impacts on selected Southern California lagoons, together with proposed or existing projects to reduce or mitigate these impacts.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/29783113</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Direct measurements of coarse sediment (gravel) transport were obtained over an interval of 14 months from a mixed sand and gravel beach on Bainbridge Island, Puget Sound, WA in order to quantify the relative role of different forcing mechanisms and the corresponding time scales of morphological response.

The sampling of the gravel tracers provides sufficient resolution to reveal the seasonal transport patterns, which include a range of wave and vessel wake climates. Simulations of cumulative transport rate predicted with the integrated modeling system compare well with the alongshore tracer movements and capture the dominant trends and variations during the time period of the measurements. The measurements and modeling reveal that the transport is dominated by wind waves in an alongshore uni-directional process that occurs mainly in winter. However, beach response is also controlled by site-specific exposure to prevailing winds and car ferry wakes. In non-storm intervals, transport is brought about by the combination of vessel wakes and tidal currents; the sub-critical car ferry wakes provide a mechanism for post-storm recovery, in this low energy restricted fetch environment.</TD></TR></table>
