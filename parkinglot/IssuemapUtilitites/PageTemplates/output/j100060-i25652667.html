It also takes a look at the studies that followed, especially the legal origins thesis. The article shows that the various approaches are complementary and that economic analysis, without supplanting the traditional comparative approach, has considerable use. At a time when the globalization of business relationships is leading more than ever to a competition between the various national laws, comparatists should include more of this dimension into their field of study. Comparatists can also take a cue from economists on how to improve the relevance and the influence of their research in the public debate.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25652669</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>The legal origins thesis—the thesis that legal origin impacts economic growth and the common law is better for economic growth than the civil law—has created hundreds of papers and citation numbers unheard of among comparative lawyers.

First, the economic debate will continue to ignore or misrepresent traditional comparative law knowledge if we do not bring our specific knowledge to the table. Second, comparative law as a discipline misses the opportunity to measure its own progress and shortcomings in view of a literature which, although on its face radically different, provides important challenges. This concerns especially the promises and shortcomings of interdisciplinarity. Third, and perhaps most importantly, our silence means that comparative law as a field remains (or increasingly becomes) irrelevant for political projects because its themes are discussed more and more by others. If we comparative lawyers want to retain (or regain) relevance, we need to bring our particular expertise to bear on projects as important as law reform.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>The first purpose of this essay is to introduce the legal origins literature to traditional comparative law and to show important connections to the traditional themes of our discipline. A second purpose is to examine both what particular critique of this literature emerges from the knowledge of traditional comparative law and where traditional comparative law itself can learn from this literature. A third purpose, finally, is to consider the continuing relevance of comparative law. Will it be replaced by economics and statistics? Or is there a value specific to comparative law that cannot be supplated?</TD></TR></table>
