Control for population size (time-averaged) reversed the effects. Inclusion of municipality dummies instead of population size, to control also for additional unobserved time-invariant municipality characteristics, gave very different results: the effects were even stronger for men, while those for women were no longer significant.

We calculated the odds of vaccination in persons that were influenza-virus-positive and the odds in those that were negative and provided a crude estimate of V/E. Logistic regression was used to obtain V/E estimates adjusted for confounding variables such as age.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Results Multivariable analysis suggested that adjustments to the crude V/E estimate were necessary for patient age and month of sampling. The annual adjusted V/E was 2005/6, 67% (95% CI 41% to 82%); 2006/7 55% (26% to 73%) and 2007/8 67% (41% to 82%). The adjusted V/E in persons <65 years was 70% (57% to 78%) and 65 years and over 46% (-17% to 75%). Estimates differed by small insignificant amounts when calculated separately for influenza A and B; by interval between illness onset and swab sample; by analysis for the period November to January in each year compared with February to April and according to viral load.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>5</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion We have demonstrated the potential of using routine virological and clinical surveillance data to provide estimates of V/E early in season and conclude that it is feasible to introduce this approach to V/E measurement into evaluation of national influenza vaccination programs.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/25764734</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background It has been hypothesised that dehydration in infancy could permanently increase sodium retention, raising blood pressure in later life.
