In these three areas there are arguable weaknesses. Our efforts to inform the international community of the US national purpose have been deterred by a lack of confidence in our tradition and hesitancy in representing it to the world. Our view of democracy has been vitiated by relativism, i.e., "this system is only one of many but is neither better nor worse than the others." Our educational system has undermined belief in the national purpose through such programs as nuclear education, which are ostensibly propagandistic efforts for unilateral nuclear disarmament. If we are to prevail in this global community fraught with schisms, we must reassert our moral posture, regain a sense of national purpose, and provide our young with a belief in this system. This paper is an effort to achieve these goals.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>This article is a proposal for creating a foreign policy position with moral dimensions.
