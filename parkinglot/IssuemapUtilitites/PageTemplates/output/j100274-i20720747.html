Those who remained obese between ages 45 and 55 in 1973 to 1983 incurred significantly higher lifetime Medicare costs than those who maintained normal weight.

Support for sensitive relationships was associated with rejection of the primacy of patient welfare over physician financial interests (P = 0.015), providing care to indigent patients (P = 0.010), reporting medical errors (P = 0.002), and participating in peer evaluations (P = 0.002).</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>7</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion: Physicians may perceive different types of relations with patients to fall on a continuum of potential for conflict with their professional role. Support for personal relationships was associated with physician demographic characteristics. More permissive interpersonal boundaries may be associated with weaker support for other professional standards.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/20720758</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background: Programs to promote colorectal cancer screening are common, yet information regarding the cost-effectiveness of such efforts is limited.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Background: Programs to promote colorectal cancer screening are common, yet information regarding the cost-effectiveness of such efforts is limited.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>2</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of patient mailings to increase rates of colorectal cancer screening.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>3</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Research Design: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized, controlled trial. The intervention involved 21,860 patients aged 50 to 80 years across 11 health centers overdue for colorectal cancer screening.

The total cost of the intervention was ?$5.48 per patient, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $94 per additional patient screened. This estimate ranged from $69 to $156, based on assumptions of the cost of the intervention components, magnitude of intervention effect, age range, and size of the targeted patient population.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>6</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusion: Tailored patient mailings are a cost-effective approach to improve rates of colorectal cancer screening.</TD></TR></table>
