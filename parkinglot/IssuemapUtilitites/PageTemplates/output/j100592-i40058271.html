Berio's serial materials are reconstructed with the help of distributional analyses and from an historical angle that has been little explored thus far: the influence of Bruno Maderna (1920-1973), Berio's mentor and close collaborator at the Studio di fonologia musicale in Milan.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41289710</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Gérard Grisey (1946-1998) was a founder of the influential 'spectral' movement. Reacting against the abstractions of serialism, spectral composers derived their musical material from the physics of sound and the mechanisms of aural perception. The present study explores the tensions between Grisey's natural sonic models and their alterations and distortions in his music. One common spectral technique is ' instrumental synthesis' -the scoring for instrumental ensemble of the partíais of a complex natural sound. Instrumental synthesis creates a musical effect which is neither atonal nor tonal in the traditional sense-rather, we can best understand this music as exhibiting an extended tonality based on the upper overtones of the harmonic series. The analysis of this extended tonality calls for new theoretical tools which can account for the complex harmonic relationships between high overtones.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Gérard Grisey (1946-1998) was a founder of the influential 'spectral' movement.

As a model of harmonic meaning based on our processes of auditory cognition, tone representation can illuminate the way we hear and understand harmony in a wide variety of works. The theory is demonstrated in a discussion of Sehoenberg's Piano Piece, Op. 11 No.2, then applied in an analysis of Grisey's Vortex Temporum (1994-6). Sketches for the piece indicate Grisey's use of distorted — 'stretched' and 'compressed' -spectra in addition to the familiar harmonic series. Applying my theory of tone representation makes possible a sensitive description of the aural effect of such distorted spectra, rather than the interpretations we frequently find of these sonorities which contradict their natural origins in Grisey's sketches.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/41289711</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Carter's music poses struggles of opposition for instance in timbre (Double Concerto), space (String Quartet No. 3) or pulse (String Quartet No. 5). His preference for the all-interval tetrachords, 4 Z15 [0, 1, 4, 6] and 4 Z29 [0, 1, 3, 7], is also well known. From these facets of Carter's music, I develop a narrative interpretation of his Petrarch sonnet-inspired solo flute piece, Scrivo in Vento (1991). Specifically, I forge narrative pathways by imagining the two tetrachords as active agents opposed in competition. Previous Scrivo analyses (Capuzzo 2002; Childs 2006) stress continuity by revealing Q-transforms and commonnote voice leading between the tetrachords. While acknowledging such features, my analysis emphasises oppositional struggle by tracing the tetrachords as separate entities which cooperate and conflict as they manoeuvre to outdo each other.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#FF9900'><B><u>Most Eligible Issuemap Info</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Carter's music poses struggles of opposition for instance in timbre (Double Concerto), space (String Quartet No. 3) or pulse (String Quartet No. 5).
