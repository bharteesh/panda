Two functional traits—leaf thickness and transfusion tissue—also increase with height and may improve water-stress tolerance. Transfusion tissue area increases enough that whole-leaf vascular volume does not change significantly with height in most trees.

Continuous monitoring of flower temperatures revealed that the highest temperatures were attained after the flowers' sexual functions were over, and experiments showed that post-anthetic warming benefited larval development, not fruit development. Midge larvae in flowers with trimmed tepals (and hence a lower temperature) died, but fruit set ratios remained unchanged. Based on the DNA phylogeny, gall midge pollination evolved from general fly/beetle pollination several times in Schisandraceae, with some species adapted to flower-breeding midges, others to pollen-feeding midges.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Flower heating may be an ancestral trait in Schisandraceae that became co-opted in species pollinated by flower-breeding midges requiring long-persistent warm chambers for larval development.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27857328</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: Fog provides a critical water resource to plants around the world.

Strikingly, P. munitum had the highest foliar uptake capacity in the center of the ecosystem and may absorb 10% more of the fog its canopy intercepts in this region relative to other regions studied. Conversely, P. munitum had no foliar uptake capacity in the southern end of the ecosystem.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: This study shows the first evidence that foliar uptake varies within species at the landscape scale. Our findings suggest that the P. munitum at the southern tip of the redwood ecosystem may suffer most from low summertime water availability because it had no potential to acquire fog as an aboveground water subsidy.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27857338</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: Natural hybridization represents an important force driving plant evolution and affecting community structure and functioning.

Northern Belize represents a hybrid zone of E. cellulosa and E. interstincta. A third participant in the hybridization events occurring in this zone is an unknown Limnochloa lineage but is not E. mutata. Interspecific hybridization may play a significant role in the diversification of Eleocharis.</TD></TR></table><P align='left' style='color:#993300'><B><u>10.2307/27857329</u></B></P><BR><P align='left' style='color:#CC66FF'><B><u>Current Issuemap</u></B></P><BR><table width='100%'><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>1</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Premise of the study: The Cucurbitaceae genus Cayaponia comprises ?60 species that occur from Uruguay to the southern United States and the Caribbean; C. africana occurs in West Africa and on Madagascar.

The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that Cayaponia originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats.</TD></TR><TR valign='top'><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>4</TD><TD width='5%' bordercolor='blue'>Conclusions: Cayaponia provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa.</TD></TR></table>
