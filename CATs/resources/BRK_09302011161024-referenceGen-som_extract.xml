    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The federal government's approach to regulating the spectrum
      remains largely administrative, causing major inefficiency and waste. Ironically, just as the
      FCC has begun to use market mechanisms, some people are pushing to treat spectrum as a common
      resource open to all entrants. Commons proponents maintain that with new,
      interference-avoiding technology, licensing is becoming unnecessary and impractical. In this
      brief study, noted economist William J. Baumol evaluates two options for spectrum governance
      &#151;a tradable license (market) approach and a commons approach. He compares the
      practicality of each in terms of six key issues: interference, adequacy of investment in
      innovation, monopoly power, preservation of diversity, service to rural areas, and the tension
      between vested interests and the need for adaptable arrangements. Baumol demonstrates that,
      while neither approach is ideal, a commons regime has severe shortcomings. Above all, he
      emphasizes the importance of impermanence in the granting of licenses to preserve the
      flexibility to adapt to unforeseen technological and other developments.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The Kashmir issue is typically cast as a "territorial dispute"
      between two belligerent neighbors in South Asia. But there is much more to the story than
      that. The Jammu and Kashmir state, home to an extraordinary medley of races, tribal groups,
      languages, and religions, makes up one of the most diverse regions in the subcontinent.
      Demystifying Kashmir argues that recognizing the rich, complex, and multi-faceted character of
      Kashmir is important not only for understanding the structural causes of this conflict but
      also for providing opportunities to establish a just, viable, and lasting solution. In this
      remarkable book, Navnita Chadha Behera traces the history of Kashmir from the pre-partition
      India to the current-day situation. She provides a comprehensive analysis of the philosophical
      underpinnings and the local, bilateral, and international dynamics of the key players involved
      in this flashpoint of conflict, including New Delhi, Islamabad, political groups and militant
      outfits on both sides of the Line of Control, and international powers. The book explores the
      political and military components of India's and Pakistan's Kashmir strategy, the
      self-determination debate, and the insurgent movement that began in 1989. The conclusion
      focuses on what Behera terms the four P's: parameters, players, politics, and prognosis of the
      ongoing peace process in Kashmir. Behera also reflects on the devastation of the October 2005
      earthquake and its implications for the future of the area. Based on extensive field research
      and primary sources, Demystifying Kashmir breaks new ground by framing the conflict as a
      political battle of state-making between India and Pakistan rather than as a rigid and
      ideological Hindu-Muslim conflict. Behera's work will be an essential guide for journalists,
      scholars, activists, policymakers, and anyone interested in how to avert a war between these
      nuclear powers.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;A few years ago, Americans held out their systems of corporate
      governance and financial disclosure as models to be emulated by the rest of the world. But in
      late 2001 U.S. policymakers and corporate leaders found themselves facing the largest
      corporate accounting scandals in American history. The spectacular collapses of Enron and
      Worldcom &#151;as well as the discovery of accounting irregularities at other large U.S.
      companies &#151;seemed to call into question the efficacy of the entire system of corporate
      governance in the United States. In response, Congress quickly enacted a comprehensive package
      of reform measures in what has come to be known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The New York Stock
      Exchange and the NASDAQ followed by making fundamental changes to their listing requirements.
      The private sector acted as well. Accounting firms &#151;watching in horror as one of their
      largest, Arthur Andersen, collapsed after a criminal conviction for document shredding
      &#151;tightened their auditing procedures. Stock analysts and ratings agencies, hit hard by a
      series of disclosures about their failings, changed their practices as well. Will these
      reforms be enough? Are some counterproductive? Are other shortcomings in the disclosure system
      still in need of correction? These are among the questions that George Benston, Michael
      Bromwich, Robert E. Litan, and Alfred Wagenhofer address in Following the Money. While the
      authors agree that the U.S. system of corporate disclosure and governance is in need of
      change, they are concerned that policymakers may be overreacting in some areas and taking
      actions in others that may prove to be ineffective or even counterproductive. Using the Enron
      case as a point of departure, the authors argue that the major problem lies not in the
      accounting and auditing standards themselves, but in the system of enforcing those standards.
      Rather than attempting to craft a single set of accounting and reporting standards for all
      companies throughout the world, the authors advise policymakers to allow competition between
      the two major sets of standards: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and International
      Financial Reporting Standards. The authors also believe that the corporate disclosure system
      needs to be updated to reflect changes in the underlying economy. In particular, they
      recommend new forms of disclosure for a variety of nonfinancial indicators to better enable
      investors and analysts to ascertain the source and nature of intangible assets. They also urge
      policymakers to exploit the advantages of the Internet by encouraging more frequent financial
      disclosures in a form that will make them more widely accessible and more easily
      used.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Turbulent Waters: Cross-Border Finance and
      International Governance&lt;/I&gt; advocates faster progress in reforming the international
      financial system. Its most important theme is the need for national governments and
      international organizations to upgrade their collective efforts at crisis prevention and
      prosperity management. The core of such efforts is the supranational surveillance of
      cross-border "traffic regulations" and the cooperative monitoring of nations' macroeconomic,
      exchange rate, and balance-of-payments policies. Concurrently, governments should streamline
      and strengthen the intermediation of intergovernmental lending for the liability financing of
      payments deficits through the International Monetary Fund. This essay gives detailed analysis
      supporting these conclusions and provides more technical discussion of the incremental policy
      measures needed to strengthen these collective efforts.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;East Asian exchange rates have become a global flashpoint. U.S.
      policymakers blame artificially low Asian currency values for global imbalances, including
      America's ballooning current account deficit. The solution, they argue, lies in some
      combination of greater exchange rate flexibility and the appreciation of Asian currencies
      against the dollar. Asian officials recognize the need to let their exchange rates rise, but
      they fear that would hamper growth and cut sharply into the value of their dollar
      reserves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Toward an East Asian Exchange Rate Regime&lt;/I&gt;
      offers a timely and comprehensive analysis of the resulting debates, drawing on expertise from
      China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. The introduction reviews the issues at
      stake, sketches a variety of proposed exchange rate regimes, and discusses comparisons between
      East Asia and the West.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Subsequent chapters examine the connection between
      global financial imbalances and East Asian monetary cooperation, China's potential role in
      regional coordination, the relationship between monetary and trade integration, and different
      paths toward regional cooperation. Authoritative yet concise, this is an essential primer on
      East Asian monetary integration. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors include Gongpil Choi (Korean

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Twice in the winter of 1999-2000, citizens of the Russian
      Federation flocked to their neighborhood voting stations and scratched their ballots in an
      atmosphere of uncertainty, rancor, and fear. This book is a tale of these two elections
      &#151;one for the 450-seat Duma, the other for President. Despite financial crisis, a national
      security emergency in Chechnya, and cabinet instability, Russian voters unexpectedly supported
      the status quo. The elected lawmakers prepared to cooperate with the executive branch, a gift
      that had eluded President Boris Yeltsin since he imposed a post-Soviet constitution by
      referendum in 1993. When Yeltsin retired six months in advance of schedule, the presidential
      mantle went to Vladimir Putin &#151;a career KGB officer who fused new and old ways of doing
      politics. Putin was easily elected President in his own right. This book demonstrates key
      trends in an extinct superpower, a troubled country in whose stability, modernization, and
      openness to the international community the West still has a huge stake.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In 2002 Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act
      (BCRA), the first major revision of federal campaign finance law in a generation. In March
      2001, after a fiercely contested and highly divisive seven-year partisan legislative battle,
      the Senate passed S. 27, known as the McCain-Feingold legislation. The House responded by
      passing H.R. 2356, companion legislation known as Shays-Meehan, in February 2002. The Senate
      then approved the House-passed version, and President George W. Bush signed BCRA into law on
      March 27, 2002, stating that the bill had "flaws" but overall "improves the current system of
      financing for federal campaigns." The Reform Act was taken to court within hours of the
      President's signature. Dozens of interest groups and lawmakers who had opposed passage of the
      Act in Congress lodged complaints that challenged the constitutionality of virtually every
      aspect of the new law. Following review by a special three-judge panel, the case is expected
      to reach the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003. This litigation constitutes the most important
      campaign finance case since the Supreme Court issued its decision in Buckley v. Valeo more

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The 1996 Telecommunications Act was an attempt to increase
      competition among telecommunications providers in the United States by reducing regulatory
      barriers to market entry. This competition was expected to drive innovation in the
      telecommunications sector and reap economic benefits for both American consumers and
      telecommunications providers. The legislation, however, had a markedly different impact. While
      many of the more aggressive providers enjoyed sharp short-term rises in stock market values,
      they soon faced sudden collapse, leaving consumers with little or no long-term
      benefit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Competition and Chaos&lt;/I&gt;, Robert W. Crandall
      analyzes the impact of the 1996 act on economic welfare in the United States and how the act
      and its antecedents affected the major telecommunications providers. He argues that the act
      was far too stringent, inviting the Federal Communications Commission and state regulators to
      micromanage competitive entry into local telecommunications markets. Combined with the
      bursting of the dot.com and telecom stock market bubbles, this aggressive policy invited new
      and existing firms to invest billions of dollars unwisely, leading to the 2001&#150;02
      collapse of equity values throughout the sector. New entrants into the market invested more
      than $50 billion in unproductive assets that were quickly wiped out through massive failures.
      The 1996 act allowed the independent long-distance companies, such as MCI and AT&amp; T, to
      live a few years longer. But today they are a threatened species, caught in a downward spiral
      of declining prices and substantial losses. The industry is preparing for an intense battle
      for market share among three sets of carriers: the wireless companies, the local telephone
      carriers, and the cable television businesses. Each has its own particular advantage in one of
      the three major segments of the market &#151;voice, data, and video &#151;but none is assured
      a clear path to dominance. Although the telecom stock market collapse is now history and the
      survivors are investing once again, Crandall concludes that the regulators have failed to
      adapt to the chaos to which they contributed.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The greater Middle East region is beset by a crescent of crises,
      stretching from Pakistan through Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq to the Israeli-Palestinian
      conflict. Together, these five crises pose the most pressing security challenges faced by the
      United States and its European allies &#151;ranging from terrorism and weapons proliferation
      to the rise of fundamentalism and the lack of democracy. Until now, Europe and the United
      States have approached these issues (indeed, the Middle East as a whole) in differing ways,
      with little effective coordination of policy. In fact, how best to deal with the greater
      Middle East has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in U.S.-European relations. The
      need for a common approach to the region is more evident than ever. This book brings together
      some of Europe and America's leading scholars and practitioners in an effort to develop a
      common approach to resolving the five major crises in the region. European and American
      authors provide succinct and fact-filled overviews of the different crises, describe U.S. and
      European perspectives on the way forward, and suggest ways in which the United States and
      Europe can better cooperate. In the conclusion, the editors synthesize the different
      suggestions into a roadmap for U.S.-European cooperation for addressing the challenges of the
      Greater Middle East in the years ahead. Contributors include Stephen Cohen (Brookings
      Institution), James Dobbins (RAND), Toby Dodge (University of London), Martin Indyk (Saban

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Environmental policy has been the focus of reform efforts for
      more than a generation. Now policymakers face a new and challenging set of issues: how to
      develop strategies for attacking new environmental problems, how to develop better strategies
      for solving the old ones, and how to do both in ways that are more efficient, less taxing, and
      engender less political opposition. On one level, environmental performance is the problem. On
      a broader level, the question is how reshaped intergovernmental partnerships will affect how
      America is governed. This book charts the politics of the next generation of environmental
      policy: how citizens will sort competing goals and responsibilities, how conflict and
      collaboration will shape the policy options, and how the nation¡¯s political institutions will
      respond. These issues raise tough political problems that will define which options are viable
      and how different options will reshape politics. The contributors outline a path to fresh
      perspectives on the critical problems that must be addressed. Contributors: Christopher H.
      Foreman Jr. (University of Maryland, Brookings Institution), Donald F. Kettl (University of

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;It was the best of elections; it was the worst of elections. The
      2004 presidential contest mobilized a record number of voters, with 121 million Americans
      showing up at the polls. But in many eyes, the 2004 race also plumbed new depths. It was the
      most expensive presidential election in history, with a price tag of $2.2 billion. It was also
      marked by unprecedented negativity &#151;for example, both George W. Bush and John Kerry came
      under fire for their activities during the Vietnam War, which ended three decades ago. In V
      &lt;I&gt;ital Signs,&lt;/I&gt; David Dulio and Candice Nelson analyze the Bush and Kerry
      campaigns and use them as the springboard for a broader exploration of the current U.S.
      campaign system and its strengths and weaknesses. The book addresses four key issues: Who's in
      charge of modern campaigns? How effective are the key players? What role does money play? And
      are campaigns being conducted in an ethical manner? In answering these questions, Dulio and
      Nelson draw on a wide range of sources, including focus groups, interviews with campaign
      professionals, and a unique dataset based on multiple surveys of political consultants, party
      operatives, and the public. The culmination of the seven-year "Improving Campaign Conduct"
      project, Vital Signs should become an integral part of the debate about American campaigns and
      elections.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;As the Internet revolution continues to unfold and transform
      telecommunications, pressure is building for faster, less expensive, and more widely
      accessible broadband service. Such a development would facilitate improved and less expensive
      traditional applications such as voice telephony and web browsing. It would also enable new
      and useful applications such as Internet-based television, videoconferencing, and software
      distribution. Broadband has great potential to improve efficiency and productivity, even to
      improve national security in some cases. Broadband service and affordability, however, have
      consistently lagged well behind demand and progress in information technology, with damaging
      results. The Internet revolution remains incomplete and threatens to stagnate if the situation
      continues. In The Broadband Problem, economist and technology entrepreneur Charles H. Ferguson
      explains the causes and ramifications of this damaging bottleneck, and he offers suggestions
      on improving the current state of affairs. He asserts that current telecommunications law and
      policy have not provided sufficient levels of new entry, competition, and innovation in the
      local telecom market. The continuing dominance of ILECs (incumbent local exchange carriers) in
      that market impedes the healthy, and much-needed, development of an efficient broadband
      market. The result of these policy and market failures is inadequate technological progress,
      innovation, and productivity in advanced Internet services and telecommunication services
      generally. The broadband problem is holding us back, and thus must be addressed and solved.
      With this important volume, Charles Ferguson has contributed mightily to that
      mission.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The private pension system, together with Social Security, has
      provided millions of Americans with income security in retirement. But over the past thirty
      years, pension coverage has stagnated, leaving behind some vulnerable groups. Defined
      contribution plans have exposed workers to greater investment risk, while cash balance and
      other hybrid plans may have adverse effects on older workers caught in the transition. Pension
      regulations, infamous for their complexity, can be bewildering to policy analysts and
      policymakers. Private Pensions and Public Policies sheds timely and much-needed light on
      specific issues within the broader context and framework of pension reform. Contributors focus
      on topics that must be addressed in any reform effort, including the effects of the shift in
      emphasis toward defined contribution plans (after the 1974 Employee Retirement Income and
      Security Act) and hybrid plans (from the 1990s); regulatory issues such as nondiscrimination
      rules and contribution limits; how to increase the information available to participants and
      improve financial education; how participants in defined contribution plans make choices on
      questions such as asset allocation, back-loaded versus front-loaded saving, and annuities
      versus lump sum distributions; and the interaction of the private pension system with Social
      Security. Contributors include Robert L. Clark (North Carolina State University), Sylvester J.

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In this memoir, Ambassador Ray Garthoff paints a dynamic
      diplomatic history of the cold war, tracing the life of the conflict from the vantage points
      of an observant insider. His intellectually formative years coincided with the earliest days
      of the cold war, and during his forty-year career, Garthoff participated in some of the most
      important policymaking of the twentieth century: &#149; In the late 1950s he carried out
      pioneering research on Soviet military affairs at the Rand Corporation. &#149; During his
      four-year tenure at the CIA (1957-61), in addition to drafting national intellingence
      estimates, Garthoff made trips to the Soviet Union with Vice President Richard Nixon and as an
      interpreter for a delegation from the Atomic Energy Commission. &#149; As a special assistant
      in the State Department, Garthoff worked with Secretary Dean Rusk., and he was directly
      involved in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. Later he served as executive officer and senior
      State Department adviser for the strategic arms limitation talks (SALT) delegation. &#149; In
      the 1970s he served as a senior Foreign Service inspector, leading missions to a number of
      countries around the globe. &#149; As U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria (1977-79), Garthoff gained
      first-hand knowledge of the workings of a communist state and of the Soviet bloc. &#149; In
      the 1980s, Garthoff wrote two major studies of American-Soviet relations. He traveled to the
      Soviet Union nearly a dozen times in the final decade of the cold war, and in the early 1990s
      he had access to the former Soviet Communist Party archives in Moscow. Garthoff¡'s journey
      through the Cold War informs the views, positions, and actions of the past. His anecdotes and
      observations will be of great value to those anticipating the challenges of reevaluating
      American post-cold war security policy.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The U.S. Constitution calls on the government to "promote the
      general welfare." In this provocative and innovative book, a distinguished roster of political
      scientists and economists evaluates its ability to carry out this task. The first section of
      the book analyzes government performance in the areas of health, transportation, housing, and
      education, suggesting why suboptimal policies often prevail. The second set of chapters
      examines two novel and sometimes controversial tools that can be used to improve policy
      design: information markets and laboratory experiments. Finally, the third part of the book
      asks how three key institutions &#151;Congress, the party system, and federalism &#151;affect
      government's ability to solve important social problems. These chapters also raise the
      disturbing possibility that recent political developments have contributed to a decline in
      governmental problem-solving activity. Taken together, the essays in this volume suggest that
      opportunities to promote the common good are frequently missed in modern American government.
      But the book also carries a more hopeful message. By identifying possible solutions to the
      problems created by weak incentives, poor information, and inadequate institutional capacity,
      Promoting the General Welfare shows how government performance can be improved. Contributors

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In August 1999 a forty-six-year-old sheep farmer name José Bové
      was arrested for dismantling the construction site of a new McDonald's restaurant in the south
      of France. A few months later Bové built on his fame by smuggling huge chunks of Roquefort
      cheese into Seattle, where he was among the leaders of the antiglobalization protests against
      the World Trade Organization summit. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bové's crusade against globalization
      helped provoke a debate both within France and beyond about the pros and cons of a world in
      which financial, commercial, human, cultural, and technology flows move faster and more
      extensively than ever before. As the French struggle to preserve the country's identity,
      heritage, and distinctiveness, they are nonetheless adapting to a new economy and an
      interdependent world. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book deals with France's effort to adapt to
      globalization and its consequences for France's economy, cultural identity, domestic politics,
      and foreign relations. The authors begin by analyzing the structural transformation of the
      French economy, driven first by liberalization within the European Union and more recently by
      globalization. By examining a wide variety of possible measures of globalization and
      liberalization, the authors conclude that the French economy's adaptation has been far
      reaching and largely successful, even if French leaders prefer to downplay the extent of these
      changes in response to political pressures and public opinion. They call this adaptation
      "globalization by stealth."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The authors also examine the relationship
      between trade, culture, and identity and explain why globalization has rendered the three
      inseparable. They show how globalization is contributing to the restructuring of the
      traditional French political spectrum and blurring the traditional differences between left
      and right. Finally, they explore France's effort to tame globalization &#151;maîtriser la
      mondialisation &#151;and the possible consequences and lessons of the French stance for the
      rest of the world.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;When it came into force in 1994, the North American Free Trade
      Agreement (NAFTA) joined the economic futures of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with
      systematic rules governing trade and investment, dispute resolution, and economic relations.
      However, economic integration among the three countries extends considerably beyond trade and
      investment. The NAFTA agreement takes a very narrow view of integration, barely addressing
      such vital issues as immigration policy and labor markets, the energy sector, environmental
      protection, and law enforcement. The governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States now
      must confront the question of whether NAFTA is enough. Do they want to keep their trilateral
      relationship focused on economic matters or are they interested in integrating more deeply
      &#151;perhaps initiating a process to build a North American Community similar to the European
      Union? This volume contains thoughtful discussions about the future of North America by
      knowledgeable experts from each of the three countries. Robert Pastor has written one of the
      more comprehensive books on the subject, Toward a North American Community (Institute for
      International Economics, 2001). Andrés Rozental is an ambassador at large for Mexico and
      president of Consejo Mexicano de Asuntos Internationacionales, the country's leading foreign
      policy association in Mexico. Perrin Beatty is a former foreign minister of Canada and
      currently the president and CEO of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters. The governments
      of Canada, the United States, and Mexico face thorny challenges as they decide whether and how
      to accelerate smooth, and institutionalize the integration process. Pastor, Rozenthal, and
      Beatty encourage greater dialogue among the three governments and their citizens, as well as
      more systematic thinking among policymakers and citizens about the promise and challenges of
      further North American integration. This volume considers the promise and challenges of
      further North American integration, including: - migration, security cooperation, and
      cross-border commerce - the establishment of a permanent North American Court on Trade and
      Investment, to replace the current ad hoc tribunals -the possibility of widening NAFTA to
      incorporate countries in Central America and the Caribbean -collaboration in dealing with
      criminal drug trafficking, environmental protection, energy and water management, and
      transportation, communications and other infrastructure development.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The Brookings Institution's Welfare Reform &amp; Beyond
      Initiative was created to inform the critical policy debates surrounding the upcoming
      congressional reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program
      and a number of related programs that were created or dramatically altered by the 1996
      landmark welfare reform legislation. The goal of the project has been to take the large volume
      of existing and forthcoming research studies and shape them into a more coherent and
      policy-oriented whole. This capstone collection gathers twenty brief essays (published between
      January 2001 and February 2002) that focus on assessing the record of welfare reform, specific
      issues likely to be debated before the TANF reauthorization, and a broader set of policy
      options for low-income families. It is a reader-friendly volume that will provide
      policymakers, the press, and the interested public with a comprehensive guide to the numerous
      issues that must be addressed as Congress considers the future of the nation's antipoverty
      policies. The collection covers the following topics and features a new introduction from the
      editors: - An Overview of Effects to Date - Welfare Reform Reauthorization: An Overview of
      Problems and Issues - A Tax Proposal for Working Families with Children - Welfare Reform and
      Poverty - Reducing Non-Marital Births - Which Welfare Reforms are Best for Children? - Welfare
      and the Economy - What Can Be Done to Reduce Teen Pregnancy and Out-of-Wedlock Births? -
      Changing Welfare Offices - State Programs - Welfare Reform and Employment - Fragile Families,
      Welfare Reform, and Marriage - Health Insurance, Welfare, and Work - Helping the
      Hard-to-Employ - Sanctions and Welfare Reform - Child Care and Welfare Reform - Job Retention
      and Advancement in Welfare Reform - Housing and Welfare Reform - Non-Citizens - Block Grant
      Structure - Food Stamps - Work Support System - Possible Welfare Reform in the
      Cities&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;These candid conversations capture the difficulties of reporting
      during crisis and war, particularly the tension between government and the press. The
      participants include distinguished journalists &#151;American and foreign, print and broadcast
      &#151;and prominent public officials, past and present. They illuminate the struggle to
      balance free speech and the right to know with the need to protect sensitive information in
      the national interest. As the Information Age collides with the War on Terrorism, that
      challenge becomes even more critical and daunting. "We are very careful in what we talk about
      publicly. We do not want to paint a picture for the bad guys. So we don't talk very much at
      all about what we're going to do going forward." &#151;Victoria Clarke, Department of Defense
      "This was a war that was very different. It was conducted primarily by about 200 to 250
      special forces soldiers on the ground. There were no reporters with those soldiers until after
      the fall of Kandahar, until the war was essentially over. There were no eyes and ears, and
      that's the way the Pentagon wants it." &#151;John McWethy, ABC News "I covered Capitol Hill
      for a very long time and was always astounded by the nonpolitical motivation of a lot of
      people that are up there who really do want to make the world better, want to make the U.S.
      better. So don't come away believing that because there are political implications that there
      are always political motivations." &#151;Candy Crowley, CNN "There is a feeling among the
      community, Muslim Americans, and also overseas that we might become the new enemy. But so far
      nobody knows whether it is just because of the war or if it's going to last." &#151;Hafez
      Al-Mirazi, Al-Jazeera&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cosponsored with the Shorenstein Center on the Press,
      Politics and Public Policy at the Kennedy School, Harvard University. &lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Americans often forget that, just as they watch the world through
      U.S. media, they are also being watched. Foreign correspondents based in the United States
      report news and provide context to events that are often unfamiliar or confusing to their
      readers back home. Unfortunately, there has been too little thoughtful examination of the
      foreign press in America and its role in the world media. Through Their Eyes fills this void
      in the unmistakable voice of Stephen Hess, who has been reporting on reporting for over a
      quarter century. Globalization is shrinking the planet, making it more important than ever to
      know what is going on in the world and how those events are being interpreted elsewhere.
      September 11 was a chilling reminder that how others perceive us does matter, like it or not.
      Hess seeks to answer three basic yet essential journalistic questions: Who are these
      U.S.-based foreign correspondents? How do they operate? And perhaps most important, what do
      they report, and how? Informed by scores of interviews and armed with original survey
      research, Hess reveals the mindset of foreign correspondents from a broad sample of countries.
      He examines how reporting from abroad has changed over the past twenty years and addresses the
      daunting challenges facing these journalists, ranging from home-office politics to national
      stereotypes. Unique among works on the subject, this book provides an engaging and humanizing
      "Day in the Life&#133;" section, illustrating how foreign correspondents conduct their daily
      activities. This book continues the author's comprehensive Newswork series on the nexus of
      media, government, and politics. These five books, starting with The Washington Reporters
      (Brookings, 1981), have become valuable reference materials for all who seek to understand
      this intersection of journalism and government. Through Their Eyes furthers that rich
      tradition, making it essential and enjoyable reading.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Can Russia ever become a normal, free-market, democratic society?
      Why have so many reforms failed since the Soviet Union's collapse? In this highly-original
      work, Fiona Hill and Clifford Gaddy argue that Russia's geography, history, and monumental
      mistakes perpetrated by Soviet planners have locked it into a dead-end path to economic ruin.
      Shattering a number of myths that have long persisted in the West and in Russia, The Siberian
      Curse explains why Russia's greatest assets&#150;&#150;its gigantic size and Siberia's natural
      resources&#150;&#150;are now the source of one its greatest weaknesses. For seventy years,
      driven by ideological zeal and the imperative to colonize and industrialize its vast
      frontiers, communist planners forced people to live in Siberia. They did this in true
      totalitarian fashion by using the GULAG prison system and slave labor to build huge factories
      and million-person cities to support them. Today, tens of millions of people and thousands of
      large-scale industrial enterprises languish in the cold and distant places communist planners
      put them&#150;&#150;not where market forces or free choice would have placed them. Russian
      leaders still believe that an industrialized Siberia is the key to Russia's prosperity. As a
      result, the country is burdened by the ever-increasing costs of subsidizing economic activity
      in some of the most forbidding places on the planet. Russia pays a steep price for continuing
      this folly&#150;&#150;it wastes the very resources it needs to recover from the ravages of
      communism. Hill and Gaddy contend that Russia's future prosperity requires that it finally
      throw off the shackles of its Soviet past, by shrinking Siberia's cities. Only by facilitating
      the relocation of population to western Russia, closer to Europe and its markets, can Russia
      achieve sustainable economic growth. Unfortunately for Russia, there is no historical
      precedent for shrinking cities on the scale that will be required. Downsizing Siberia will be
      a costly and wrenching process. But there is no alternative. Russia cannot afford to keep the
      cities communist planners left for it out in the cold.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Bringing change to our public school system is hard, and the
      current system of education governance creates barriers that can make that reform even harder.
      Here six authorities in public education discuss how local philanthropies can overcome them
      even if school districts cannot. Making School Reform Work identifies new institutions that
      can be created by foundations and civic groups to remedy deficiencies in local school
      governance, formulate bold reforms, and guarantee implementation. These institutions include
      incubators for starting new schools, independent data analysis centers, public-private
      partnerships for recruitment and training of school leaders, and new ways of funding and
      managing school facilities. The contributors are Sarah Brooks (Carleton College), Michael
      DeArmond (University of Washington), Marguerite Roza (University of Washington), and Abigail
      Winger (Milwaukee consultant).&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;School boards are fighting for their survival. Almost everything
      that they do is subject to regulations handed down from city councils, state boards of
      education, legislatures, and courts. As recent mayoral and state takeovers in such cities as
      Baltimore, Chicago, and New York make abundantly clear, school boards that do not fulfill the
      expectations of other political players may be stripped of what few independent powers they
      still retain. Teachers unions exert growing influence over board decision-making processes.
      And with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, the federal government has aggressively
      inserted itself into matters of local education governance. B &lt;I&gt;esieged &lt;/I&gt;is
      the first full-length volume in many years to systematically examine the politics that
      surround school boards. A group of highly renowned scholars, relying on both careful case
      studies and quantitative analyses, examine how school boards fare when they interact with
      their political superiors, teachers unions, and the public. For the most part, the picture
      that emerges is sobering: while school boards perform certain administrative functions quite
      well, the political pressures they face undermine their capacity to institute the wide-ranging
      school reforms that many voters and local leaders are currently demanding.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The voucher debate has been both intense and ideologically
      polarizing, in good part because so little is known about how voucher programs operate in
      practice. In The Education Gap, William Howell and Paul Peterson report new findings drawn
      from the most comprehensive study on vouchers conducted to date. Added to the paperback
      edition of this groundbreaking volume are the authors' insights into the latest school choice
      developments in American education, including new voucher initiatives, charter school
      expansion, and public-school choice under No Child Left Behind. The authors review the
      significance of state and federal court decisions as well as recent scholarly debates over
      choice impacts on student performance. In addition, the authors present new findings on which
      parents choose private schools and the consequences the decision has for their children's
      education. Updated and expanded, The Education Gap remains an indispensable source of original
      research on school vouchers. "This is the most important book ever written on the subject of
      vouchers." &#151;John E. Brandl, dean, Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs,
      University of Minnesota "The Education Gap will provide an important intellectual battleground
      for the debate over vouchers for years to come." &#151;Alan B. Krueger, Princeton University
      "Must reading for anyone interested in the battle over vouchers in America." &#151;John Witte,
      University of Wisconsin &lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In this frank and engaging book, foreign minister Igor S. Ivanov
      describes the evolution of Russian foreign policy since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
      Drawing on Russia's long diplomatic history, Ivanov analyzes the complex process through which
      a newly democratic Russia has redefined its foreign policy during a volatile transformation
      over the last decade. The book includes the text of Russia's Foreign Policy Concept, a Putin
      administration document that guides the day-to-day activities of the government. Designed to
      provide the world community with a transparent outline of Russia's foreign policy agenda, the
      Concept attempts to balance Russia's important role in the new world order with internal
      pressures to focus on domestic stability. The radical transformation of the past decade has
      required a complete overhaul of the process by which foreign policy is crafted, implemented,
      and communicated, according to Ivanov. The Concept delineates the role of parliament in making
      foreign policy decisions, the interrelationship of the legislative and executive branches, and
      the apportionment of authority among the president, government, and regional authorities. It
      also stresses the need to renovate Russia's diplomatic service, whose tradition of
      professionally trained diplomats dates back to Peter the Great. While acknowledging the
      impulse to recreate foreign policy from scratch during periods of revolutionary change and
      radical reform, Ivanov stresses the theoretical and practical importance of continuity.
      Although the modern political system of the Russian Federation has no analogue in Russian
      history, Ivanov draws compelling connections between the country's contemporary challenges and
      the rich legacy of Russian and Soviet diplomacy &#151;in the process invoking the political
      philosophies of historical Russian leaders from ancient Rus' to Alexander Gorchakov. The New
      Russian Diplomacy was originally published in Russia, where it received very favorable
      reviews. This volume is a special edition prepared for American readers with a new
      introduction and an expanded and updated discussion of the U.S.-Russian
      relationship.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Since the early 1990s, federal transportation laws have slowly
      started to level the playing field between highway and alternative transportation strategies,
      as well as between older and newer communities. The Intermodal Surface Transportation
      Efficiency Act of 1991 and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century made substantial
      changes in transportation practices. These laws devolved greater responsibility for planning
      and implementation to urban development organizations and introduced more flexibility in the
      spending of federal highway and transit funds. They also created a series of special programs
      to carry out important national objectives, and they tightened the linkages between
      transportation spending and issues such as metropolitan air quality. Taking the High Road
      examines the most pressing transportation challenges facing American cities, suburbs, and
      metropolitan areas. The authors focus on the central issues in the ongoing debate and
      deliberations about the nation's transportation policy. They go beyond the federal debate,
      however, to lay out an agenda for reform that responds directly to those responsible for
      putting these policies into practice &#151;leaders at the state, metropolitan, and local
      levels. This book presents public officials with options for reform. Hoping to build upon the
      progress and momentum of earlier transportation laws, it ensures a better understanding of the
      problems and provides policymakers, journalists, and the public with a comprehensive guide to
      the numerous issues that must be addressed. Topics include &#149; A wide-ranging policy
      framework that addresses the reauthorization debate &#149; An examination of transportation
      finance and how it affects cities and suburbs &#149; An analysis of metropolitan
      decisionmaking in transportation &#149; The challenges of transportation access for working
      families and the elderly &#149; The problems of increasing traffic congestion and the lack of
      adequate alternatives Contributors include Scott Bernstein (Center for Neighborhood

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;This lively and innovative book is about computer code and the
      legal controls and restrictions on those who write it. The widespread use of personal
      computers and the Internet have made it possible to release new data or tools instantaneously
      to virtually the entire world. However, while the digital revolution allows quick and
      extensive use of these intellectual properties, it also means that their developers face new
      challenges in retaining their rights as creators. Drawing on a host of examples, Ben Klemens
      describes and analyzes the intellectual property issues involved in the development of
      computer software. He focuses on software patents because of their powerful effect on the
      software market, but he also provides an extensive discussion of how traditional copyright
      laws can be applied to code. The book concludes with a discussion of recommendations to ease
      the constraints on software development. This is the first book to confront these problems
      with serious policy solutions. It is sure to become the standard reference for software
      developers, those concerned with intellectual property issues, and for policymakers seeking
      direction. It is critical that public policy on these issues facilitates progress rather than
      hindering it. There is too much at stake.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In 1994 genocide in Rwanda claimed the lives of at least 500,000
      Tutsi &#151;some three-quarters of their population &#151;while UN peacekeepers were withdrawn
      and the rest of the world stood aside. Ever since, it has been argued that a small military
      intervention could have prevented most of the killing. In The Limits of Humanitarian
      Intervention, Alan J. Kuperman exposes such conventional wisdom as
      myth.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Combining unprecedented analyses of the genocide's progression and the
      logistical limitations of humanitarian military intervention, Kuperman reaches a startling
      conclusion: even if Western leaders had ordered an intervention as soon as they became aware
      of a nationwide genocide in Rwanda, the intervention forces would have arrived too late to
      save more than a quarter of the 500,000 Tutsi ultimately killed. Serving as a cautionary
      message about the limits of humanitarian intervention, the book's concluding chapters address
      lessons for the future.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In this important new book, C.H. Kwan asks whether the Japanese
      yen can, or will, replace the dollar as the key currency in East Asia. Kwan analyzes the
      implications for Japan and Asia's developing countries should they come together to form a yen
      bloc &#151;a grouping of countries that use the yen as an international currency and maintain
      stable exchange rates against the yen. Combining academic analysis with his experience
      advising the Japanese prime minister and the Japanese minister of finance, Kwan concludes that
      a yen bloc might benefit Asia's developing countries &#151;as well as Japan &#151;while
      contributing to a more stable international monetary order. Kwan's book represents the first
      attempt to explore systematically the possibility of monetary integration in Asia. It also
      provides a vision for regional integration in Asia in the twenty-first century.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Some of today's best urban leaders don't work for the government
      &#151;they can be found in nonprofit organizations that serve the working class and poor
      populations. Based on interviews conducted in major cities including Atlanta, Chicago,
      Houston, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and New York, this study focuses on exceptional
      leaders who have developed effective solutions to the complex problems of our inner cities,
      including education, economic development, and community safety. The book includes profiles of
      innovators such as Robert Woodson, founder of the Washington, D.C. based National Center for
      Neighborhood Enterprise, whose work on affordable housing, gang violence, and black
      entrepreneurship earned a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship (the "genius" award); MacArthur
      Fellowship and Heinz Prize winner Bob Moses, founder of the Algebra Project that prepares
      low-income students for joining today's technology-dominated workforce; Rheedlen Center head
      Geoff Canada, who received the Heinz Prize for his "anti-violence among youth" work; and
      Reverend Eugene Rivers, one of the founders of the Ten-Point Coalition that helped to reduce
      gang violence in Boston. The New Urban Leadership investigates how and why expert problem
      solvers chose their career paths, what qualities make them especially successful in their
      work, and the methods they use to train the next generation of urban leaders.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Overwhelmed by a proliferation of foreign aid programs, the U.S.
      government is attempting to reorganize itself in order to manage them more effectively. This
      raises several critical issues that will shape U.S. foreign aid policy for the 21st century:
      Should existing foreign aid agencies be combined into a cabinet-level agency, ensuring a voice
      for development concerns during policy discussions, or should they be placed in the State
      Department to strengthen their foreign policy focus? How should aid agencies manage the
      planning, implementation, and evaluation of their aid? Is "managing for results" as currently
      practiced appropriate for what is often a highly experimental task of bringing about
      beneficial changes in foreign countries? How should the U.S. government educate its citizens
      on the issues of foreign aid and development as expenditures rise and as the ambitious goals
      driving aid &#151;including nation building &#151;expand? In Organ &lt;I&gt;izing Foreign Aid,
      Car&lt;/I&gt;ol Lancaster and Ann Van Dusen call for a fundamental reorganization of U.S. aid
      programs. They recommend a major increase in efforts at development education. The authors
      also provide insights into how other donor governments have dealt with these challenges. With
      the future of U.S. foreign aid policy at stake, this book will be essential reading for anyone
      interested in development, foreign aid, and the organization of government programs in these
      areas.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The "war on terror" and the battle in Iraq provided the framework
      for George W. Bush's first term in office. As he embarked on a second term, the president
      reaffirmed his administration's commitment to a transformative Middle East agenda that now
      includes the challenges of promoting democracy, non-proliferation, and Israeli-Palestinian
      peace. The Saban Center at the Brookings Institution commissioned a group of its experts to
      critique the Bush administration's first-term performance and present alternative approaches
      for its second term. T &lt;I&gt;he Road Ahead &lt;/I&gt;covers the full set of challenges
      confronting President Bush in his second term: from fighting Binladenism to promoting Arab
      reform; from achieving Middle East peace to saving Iraq; and from tackling Iran to engaging
      Syria and Saudi Arabia. The contributors argue that the Bush administration will need to
      develop an integrated Middle East strategy that improves the prospects for achieving a
      priority identified during the 2004 presidential campaign: strengthening alliances and
      utilizing them to ease the burden on American leadership. Th &lt;I&gt;e Road Ahead
      p&lt;/I&gt;rovides the necessary elements for a genuinely integrated strategic framework that
      will help decisionmakers manage both the changes and the continuities in America's post-9/11
      Middle East policy. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors: Martin Indyk, Flynt Leverett, Kenneth
      Pollack, James Steinberg, Shibley Telhami, and Tamara Cofman Wittes, all connected with the

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In the late 1980s, Japan's strong economic performance put it on
      a the verge of becoming a major player in regional and global affairs. But nearly a decade of
      economic stagnation, a mounting of bad debts, and a continuing stream of scandals have
      tarnished the country's distinctive economic model. At the turn of the millennium, the
      Japanese economy remained mired in a pattern of stagnation. As this disappointing condition
      dragged on, the government pursued policies to restore economic health. Yet Japan has been
      slow to embrace the systemic reform on which a robust economic recovery depends. In Arthritic
      Japan, Edward J. Lincoln examines the causes and implications of this weak response.
      Concluding that Japan is unlikely to pursue the vigorous reform necessary for economic growth,
      Lincoln warns of serious consequences: a stumbling economy bedeviled by recession and
      financial crisis, eroding leadership in economic and security issues, a continued defensive
      trade posture, and a disgruntled population that could turn a more nationalistic stance in
      foreign policy.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Arms control and missile defense are once again at the forefront
      of the American national security agenda. Not surprisingly, the debate has broken down along
      well-worn lines. Arms control advocates dismiss the idea of missile defense as a dangerous and
      costly folly. Missile defense advocates argue that the U.S. should move aggressively to defend
      itself against missile attack. With clear and lively prose free of partisan rhetoric,
      Defending America provides reliable, factual analysis of the missile defense debate. Written
      for a general audience, it assesses the current and likely future missile threat to the United
      States, examines relevant technologies, and suggests how America's friends and foes would
      react to a decision to build a national missile defense. Lindsay and O'Hanlon reject calls for
      large-scale systems as well as proposals to do nothing, instead arguing for a limited national
      missile defense.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Throughout the 1990s, numerous financial crises rocked the world
      financial sector. The Asian bubble burst, for example; Argentina and Brazil suffered currency
      crises; and the post-Soviet economy bottomed out in Russia. In Financial Crises, a
      distinguished group of economists and policy analysts examine and draw lessons from attempts
      to recover from past crises. They also consider some potential hazards facing the world
      economy in the 21st century and discuss ways to avoid them and minimize the severity of any
      future downturn. This important new volume emerges from the seventh annual conference on
      emerging markets finance, cosponsored and organized by the World Bank and the Brookings
      Institution. In the book, noted experts address the following questions: How effective were
      post-crisis policies in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and East and Central Asia? Where do
      international financial markets stand ten years after the worldwide debt crisis? How can the
      provision of financial services resume vigorously, yet safely? What are the viable policy
      options for reducing systemic financial vulnerability? What will the next emerging-market
      financial crisis look like? Will lessons learned from past experiences help to avoid future
      disasters? How can nations reform their pension systems to deal with retirement challenges in
      the 21st century?&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The Future of Domestic Capital Markets in Developing Countries
      addresses the challenges that countries face as they develop and strengthen capital markets.
      Based on input from the world's most prominent capital market experts and leading policymakers
      in developing countries, this volume represents the latest thinking in capital market
      development. It captures the views of a global gathering of experts, with perspectives from
      developing and developed countries, from all regions of the world, from the public and private
      sector. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This volume should be of interest to senior financial sector
      policymakers from developed and developing countries in securities and exchange commissions,
      regulators, central banks, ministries of finance, and monetary authorities; private sector
      executives in stock exchanges, bond markets, venture capital markets, and investment funds;
      and researchers and academicians with an interest in capital market development in emerging
      markets. What are the key factors threatening the development and survival of stock exchanges
      in developing countries? What domestic strategies are needed to protect the future of local
      markets? Should exchanges consider linkages or alliances? Merging with, or buying up, other
      exchanges? Demutualization? The volume provides practical guidance on strategies such as
      nurturing issuers, improving rules and institutions, addressing regulatory challenges, and
      sequencing reforms. The contributors address a variety of country experiences, and suggest
      steps that policymakers and practitioners in emerging markets can take to promote an orderly
      transition toward efficient, well-regulated, and accessible capital
      markets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors include Reena Aggarwal (Georgetown University),

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;What¡'s happened to the longstanding traditions of civility and
      decorum within the world's greatest deliberative body? While the Senate hasn't yet become as
      rancorous as the House, over the past three decades it has grown noticeably less collegial. In
      Esteemed Colleagues, leading congressional scholars address the extent to which civility has
      declined in the U.S. Senate, and how that decline has affected our political system. The
      contributors analyze the relationships between Senators, shaped by high levels of both
      individualism and partisanship, and how these ties shape the deliberation of issues before the
      chamber. Civility and deliberation have changed in recent decades, up to and including the
      Clinton impeachment process, and the book sheds light on both the current American politics
      and the broad issues of representation, responsiveness, and capacity within our governmental
      institutions.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The 2002 midterm elections were noteworthy U.S. congressional
      campaigns for many reasons. They marked the last national contests before implementation of
      the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) and thus were expected by many to be the "last
      hurrah" for soft money. These midterm campaigns provided a window on the activity of parties,
      interest groups, and political consultants on the eve of BCRA, as they prepared to enter a new
      era of American elections. The results of Campaign 2002 were remarkable. As the party in
      power, the Republicans defied history by gaining seats in both houses of Congress, giving them
      a majority in the Senate. To some degree this resulted from the GOP's new emphasis on "ground
      war" voter mobilization. Another key was the unusually aggressive support of the sitting
      president, who leveraged his popularity to advance his party's candidates for Congress. Th
      &lt;I&gt;e Last Hurrah? a&lt;/I&gt;nalyzes the role of soft money and issue advocacy in the
      2002 battle for Congress. Having been granted access to a number of campaign operations across
      a broad array of groups, David Magleby, Quin Monson, and their colleagues monitored and
      documented a number of competitive races, including the key South Dakota and Missouri Senate
      contests. Each case study breaks down the campaign communication in a particular race,
      including devices such as advertising, get-out-the-vote drives, "soft money" expenditures, and
      the increasingly influential role of the national parties on local races. They also discuss
      the overall trends of the midterm election of 2002, paying particular attention to the impact
      of President Bush and his political operation in candidate recruitment, fundraising, and
      campaign visits. Magleby and Monson consider an important question typically overlooked. How
      do voters caught in the middle of a hotly contested race deal with &#151;and react to &#151;a
      barrage of television and radio ads, direct mail, unsolicited phone calls, and other campaign
      communications? They conclude with a look to the future, using the trends in 2002 to
      understand just how candidates, political parties, and interest groups might respond to the
      new campaign environment of BCRA.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Africa is working toward the goal of creating a common currency
      that would serve as a symbol of African unity. The advantages of a common currency include
      lower transaction costs, increased stability, and greater insulation of central banks from
      pressures to provide monetary financing. Disadvantages relate to asymmetries among countries,
      especially in their terms of trade and in the degree of fiscal discipline. More disciplined
      countries will not want to form a union with countries whose excessive spending puts upward
      pressure on the central bank's monetary expansion. In T &lt;I&gt;he Monetary Geography of
      Africa,&lt;/I&gt; Paul Masson and Catherine Pattillo review the history of monetary
      arrangements on the continent and analyze the current situation and prospects for further
      integration. They apply lessons from both experience and theory that lead to a number of
      conclusions. To begin with, West Africa faces a major problem because Nigeria has both
      asymmetric terms of trade &#151;it is a large oil exporter while its potential partners are
      oil importers &#151;and most important, large fiscal imbalances. Secondly, a monetary union
      among all eastern or southern African countries seems infeasible at this stage, since a number
      of countries suffer from the effects of civil conflicts and drought and are far from achieving
      the macroeconomic stability of South Africa. Lastly, the plan by Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda
      to create a common currency seems to be generally compatible with other initiatives that could
      contribute to greater regional solidarity. However, economic gains would likely favor Kenya,
      which, unlike the other two countries, has substantial exports to its neighbors, and this may
      constrain the political will needed to proceed. A more promising strategy for monetary
      integration would be to build on existing monetary unions &#151;the CFA franc zone in western
      and central Africa and the Common Monetary Area in southern Africa. Masson and Pattillo argue
      that the goal of a creating a single African currency is probably beyond reach. Economic
      realities suggest that grand new projects for African monetary unions are unlikely to be
      successful. More important for Africa's economic well-being will be to attack the more
      fundamental problems of corruption and governance.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Are liability "crises" an inevitable part of the modern
      industrial landscape? Does the inherent nature of the insurance industry promote recurring
      liability crises? What have been the effects of the liability reforms of the 1990s? Should
      lawyers be given de facto regulatory authority? This report provides perspective on these and
      other key issues concerning the law and economics of products liability. The authors begins
      with a brief description of the evolution of products liability doctrine in the U.S., up to
      the point of the liability crisis of the late 1980s. They discuss the economic implications of
      product risk for both consumers and producers, offer economic hypothesis on the implications
      of the increased scope of liability and subsequent reforms, and provide an update of trends in
      litigation and liability law. The book ends with a discussion of pending legislation and
      prospects for further improvements. Moore and Viscusi make the point that effective liability
      policy calls for a balancing of the incentives for improved public safety on one hand, and the
      benefits of new and existing products on the other.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;To many, the term "campaign ethics" is an oxymoron. Questionable
      campaign conduct occurs at many levels, from national presidential elections to local delegate
      contests. Campaign ethics goes beyond mere "ethical dilemmas," or trying to decide whether or
      not a particular act is above board. The chapters in this volume examine the broad questions
      of ethics in campaigns from the perspective of those actors that play critical roles in them,
      as well as the scholars who study them. The contributors &#151;who include leading academics,
      as well as practitioners from the world of campaigning and campaign reform &#151;outline,
      assess, and critique the role and responsibilities of candidates, citizens, organized interest
      groups, political parties, professional campaign consultants, and the media, in insuring
      ethical campaigns. Contributors include: Robert E. Denton (Virginia Tech University), David A.
      Dulio (Oakland University), Brad Rourke (Institute for Global Ethics), Robin Kolodny (Temple
      University), L. Dale Lawton (Institute for Global Ethics), L. Sandy Maisel (Colby College),

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Federal policies have made great progress protecting the
      environment. But the policies sometimes have imposed inordinate costs on local governments.
      Managing Green Mandates describes how various federal environmental directives do not suit
      diverse conditions at the local level, and compel local communities to spend their revenues on
      reducing relatively minor risks to the public health. While policymakers have thrown
      far-reaching requirements at the feet of local authorities, the federal government is
      providing them less aid to comply with the increasingly stringent standards. The burden of
      these underfunded mandates can further disadvantage many overtaxed municipalities. Pietro
      Nivola is a senior fellow in the Governmental Studies program at the Brookings Institution. He
      is the author of The Laws of the Landscape: How Politics Shape Cities in Europe and America
      (Brookings 1999). Jon Shields is a graduate student in the Department of Government and
      Foreign Affairs at the University of Virginia.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;During the past decade, dozens of large cities lost population as
      jobs and people kept moving to the suburbs. Despite widespread urban revitalization and
      renewal, one fact remains unmistakable: when choosing where to live and work, Americans prefer
      the suburbs to the cities. Many underlying causes of the urban predicament are familiar:
      disproportionate poverty, stiff city tax rates, and certain unsatisfactory municipal services
      (most notably, public schools). Less recognized is the distinct possibility that sometimes the
      regulatory policies of the federal government &#151;the rules and rulings imposed by its
      judges, bureaucrats, and lawmakers &#151;further disadvantage the cities, ultimately burdening
      their ability to attract residents and businesses. In Tense Commandments, Pietro S. Nivola
      encourages renewed reflection on the suitable balance between national and local domains. He
      examines an array of directive or supervisory methods by which federal policymakers narrow
      local autonomy and complicate the work urban governments are supposed to do. Urban taxpayers
      finance many costly projects that are prescribed by federal law. A handful of national rules
      bore down on local governments before 1965. Today these governments labor under hundreds of
      so-called unfunded mandates. Federal aid to large cities has lagged behind a profusion of
      mandated expenditures, at times straining municipal budgets. Apart from their fiscal impacts,
      Nivola argues, various federal prescriptions impinge on local administration of routine
      services, tying the hands of managers and complicating city improvements. Nivola includes case
      studies of six cities: Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Los
      Angeles. He describes the "politics of paternalism," the political pressures that federal
      regulations place on governance. Then he offers comparisons with various political systems
      abroad, including Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy. As the nation and its cities brace for
      a long and arduous effort to combat terrorism, Nivola recommends that federal mandates be
      evaluated with a standard question: are they socially beneficial, or do they deprive
      localities of discretion, distort legitimate local priorities, and perhaps misallocate
      resources? In today's intricate federal system, the unencumbered capacity of governments at
      all levels to define their roles and concentrate on their core functions and responsibilities
      seems urgent.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The Brookings Institution has long produced an analysis of
      America's defense budgets and policies. The war on terror and the ongoing operations in Iraq
      and Afghanistan have forced upon this country soaring defense budgets and unprecedented
      challenges in policymaking. In the newest installment in this tradition, leading foreign
      policy expert Michael O'Hanlon offers policy recommendations for strengthening the ability of
      America's military to respond to international crises in a tumultuous world. The United States
      can, for the foreseeable future, be confident that its armed forces will remain engaged in
      Iraq, as well as in Afghanistan and other theaters in the war on terror. It will also need to
      remain involved in deterrence missions in the western Pacific, most notably in Korea and the
      Taiwan Strait. It will wish to remain engaged in European security, since the capabilities and
      cohesion of the NATO alliance have important implications for the United States globally.
      O'Hanlon reviews these priorities, asking tough questions and developing frameworks for
      answering them: &#149; What military will the United States need in the future? &#149; How
      much will it cost? &#149; How can the U.S. increase the size of its ground forces without
      increasing the size of the defense budget? &#149; In an era of apocalyptic terror threats, and
      at a time of $400 billion defense budgets and $400 billion federal budget deficits, how can
      this country protect its citizens while maintaining fiscal responsibility?&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Metropolitan growth and development results from a complex mix of
      factors. Consumer preferences, growth and geographical shifts in population, increasing
      incomes, market restructuring, quality of schools, and location of affordable housing are just
      a few that play a critical role. Other important influences include state and local
      interactions, historical circumstances, and the natural topography of a metropolitan area.
      Federal and state policies, taken together, set the "rules of the development game" that tend
      to facilitate economic decentralization, the concentration of poverty, and greater fiscal and
      racial disparities between communities. In S &lt;I&gt;unbelt/Frostbelt,&lt;/I&gt; Janet
      Rothenberg Pack and her contributors examine the role of market forces and government policies
      in shaping growth and development patterns in major metropolitan areas. The findings are a
      result of a multiyear project analyzing five different locales: two sunbelt metro areas (Los
      Angeles and Phoenix) and three in northern climes (Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Philadelphia).
      Through its intensive study of these areas, the book offers a deep understanding of the
      federal policies and diverse market forces that have affected urban development patterns in
      the last few decades. Despite the diversity of the cities, the contributors find remarkable
      similarities in the problems they face. Urban sprawl and spatial inequality are among the
      common challenges attributable to market forces and public policies. Despite the many
      similarities, the book finds important differences in the extent of the problems and
      recommends numerous policies for remedying them. It concludes by examining how these different
      sunbelt and frostbelt metro areas have attempted to adopt policy reforms that address their
      unique growth challenges. Contributors include a team of researchers from Arizona State
      University, Peter Dreier (Occidental College), Robert E. Gleeson (Northern Illinois
      University), Joseph Gyourko (University of Pennsylvania), Pascale Joassart-Marcelli
      (University of Massachusetts, Boston), Manuel Pastor Jr. (University of California, Santa
      Cruz), Jerry R. Paytas (Carnegie Mellon University), Joseph Persky and Kimberly Schaffer
      (University of Illinois at Chicago), Anita A. Summers (University of Pennsylvania), Wim Wiewel

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;This revised and updated paperback edition covers the
      introduction of the euro, the fall of Milosevic, and the impact of September 11 in European
      integration. The rejuvenation of Europe as a totalitarian century ends and a global century
      begins is a remarkable story. This book brings together the three dynamics of Europe's
      position at this extraordinary moment: European monetary union, the deepening of intra-EU
      cooperation, and the widening of the EU and NATO to take in central European members. It looks
      at the broad political and policy implications of EMU and shows how the United States views
      this integration. Elizabeth Pond, a longtime observer of events in Europe and Russia, sees
      these developments as the beginning of a new postnational European system that is replacing
      the centuries-old nation-state system. She shows how belligerence and anarchy have faded away
      on the European continent as compulsory cold war cooperation becomes a habit and as
      French-German reconciliation becomes the pattern for reconciliation between other old enemies.
      She follows NATO's transformation into a reluctant peacemaker in Bosnia and the United States'
      decision to remain a European power. She describes the leap of faith needed to create European
      monetary union and charts the magnetic attraction of both NATO and the EU in shaping the
      democratic, economic, and social revolutions in central Europe. She warns about the strains
      that will face the transatlantic relationship when the euro is on a par with the dollar as a
      reserve currency. And she concludes by agreeing with former Polish foreign minister Wladyslaw
      Barteszewski that we are witnessing, after the original birth of European consciousness a
      millennium ago, the rebirth of Europe.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Poor people spend their money living day to day. How can they
      accumulate wealth? In the United States, homeownership is often the answer. Homes not only
      provide shelter but also are assets, and thus a means to create equity. Mortgage credit
      becomes a crucial factor. More Americans than ever now have some access to credit. However.
      thanks in large part to the growth of global capital markets and greater use of "credit
      scores," not all homeowners have benefited equally from the opened spigots. Different terms
      and conditions mean that some applicants are overpaying for mortgage credit, while some are
      getting in over their heads. And the door is left wide open for predatory lenders. In this
      important new volume, accomplished analysts examine the situation, illustrate its
      ramifications, and recommend steps to improve it. Today, low-income Americans have more access
      to credit than ever before. The challenge is to increase the chances that homeownership
      becomes the new pathway to asset-building that everyone hopes it will be.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;A generation ago little attention was focused on low-income
      homeownership. Today homeownership rates among under-served groups, including low-income
      households and minorities, have risen to record levels. These groups are no longer at the
      margin of the housing market; they have benefited from more flexible underwriting standards
      and greater access to credit. However, there is still a racial/ethnic gap and the
      homeownership rates of minority and low-income households are still well below the national
      average. This volume gathers the observations of housing experts on low-income homeownership
      and its effects on households and communities. The book is divided into five chapters which
      focus on the following subjects: homeownership trends in the 1990s; overcoming borrower
      constraints; financial returns to low-income homeowners; low-income loan performance; and the
      socioeconomic impact of homeownership.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;With so much attention paid to America's war on terror in
      Afghanistan and Iraq, the world has all but forgotten the spread of terrorism in other
      regions. From South Asia to South America, terrorist groups are on the rise. One of the most
      dangerous regions is the greater Horn of Africa along with Yemen, its volatile neighbor. This
      book offers authoritative insight into the struggle against terrorism in the Horn &#151;what
      has been done and what work remains. Robert Rotberg and his colleagues analyze the situation
      in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The esteemed contributors
      are prominent scholars and practitioners, including several former U.S. ambassadors. Their
      contributions reveal how each country's government &#151;with or without U.S. help &#151;is
      (or is not) working to combat terrorism within its own borders and to prevent its spread.
      Rotberg provides an overview of the entire region, drawing lessons particularly for U.S.
      policy. Ba &lt;I&gt;ttling Terror in the Horn of Africa i&lt;/I&gt;s a handbook on what needs
      to be done at the tension-filled crossroads of Arabia and Africa. It is important reading for
      all those with an interest in African or Middle Eastern affairs or the need to learn more
      about international terrorism. Contributors include Robert D. Burrowes (University of
      Washington), Timothy Carney (former U.S. ambassador to Sudan), Johnnie Carson (former
      ambassador to Kenya), Dan Connell (Grassroots International), Kenneth J. Menkhaus (Davidson
      College), Robert I. Rotberg (Harvard University), and Lange Schemerhorn (former ambassador to
      Djibouti).&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In this unusually candid book, Japan's former top financial
      diplomat asserts the urgent need for wholesale structural reform to revitalize the
      long-stagnant Japanese economy. Eisuke Sakakibara, whose influence over global currency
      markets earned him the nickname of "Mr. Yen," envisions a social and economic revolution that
      encompasses all sectors of Japanese society. Whereas previous analyses of Japanese policies of
      the past decade focus narrowly on such issues as nonperforming assets and deregulation,
      Sakakibara provides a new perspective. Japan's economic problems are structural, rather than
      cyclical, according to Sakakibara. Profitable investment opportunities are hard to find in the
      dysfunctional corporate sector, where costs are high and income continues to decline. The
      country's entrenched power elite &#151;the Liberal Democratic Party, the bureaucracy, and
      vested interest groups &#151;are threatened by reform efforts. It will be difficult to restore
      economic health to Japan until its political leaders are able to break the grip of this "iron
      triangle" and implement aggressive, widespread reforms. This book furthers the understanding
      that structural reform or new institution building in Japan needs an all-encompassing approach
      that includes the various sectors of Japanese society and the economy. Only with this kind of
      understanding can pragmatic and meaningful structural reform in Japan be implemented.

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Biological resource centers (BRCs) collect, certify, and
      distribute organisms for use in research and in the development of commercial products in the
      pharmaceutical, agricultural, and biotechnology industries. They maintain a large and varied
      collection, including cell lines, micro-organisms, recombinant DNA material, biological media
      and reagents, and the information technology tools that allow researchers to access biological
      materials. BRCs have established themselves as a crucial element in the life science
      innovation infrastructure, from their early impact on virology, to their crucial role in
      addressing cross-culture contamination in the 1970s, to their current leadership in promoting
      a global biodiversity network. Today they confront new challenges, resulting from shifts in
      the nature of biological research, the interaction between public and private researchers, and
      the increasing focus on biosecurity. This book provides a systematic economic assessment of
      the impact of biological resource centers through their role in facilitating cumulative
      knowledge in the life sciences and building on their roles as knowledge hubs
      &#151;institutions that facilitate the transfer of scientific and technical knowledge among
      members of a research community. The knowledge hubs framework offers insight into how to
      develop and evaluate policy proposals that impinge on the control and access of biological
      materials. Stern argues that science and innovation policy must be premised on a clear
      understanding of the role that knowledge hubs play and the policy mechanisms that encourage
      their sustained growth and effectiveness. &lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Efforts to promote work have been the centerpiece of welfare
      reform over the past ten years. In signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
      Reconciliation Act of 1996, President Bill Clinton pledged that the sweeping overhaul would
      "end welfare as we know it" by promoting work, responsibility, and family. To accomplish these
      goals, policymakers relied on two sets of tools: strict limits on eligibility for traditional
      benefits and a set of programs designed to make work pay. When Work Is Not Enough presents the
      first comprehensive analysis of the work support system. Drawing on both state and national
      data, Robert Stoker and Laura Wilson evaluate a broad range of policies that provide cash or
      in-kind benefits to low-wage workers, low-income working families, and families moving from
      welfare to work. These programs include minimum wage rates, Earned Income Tax Credit programs,
      medical assistance programs, food programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families earned
      income disregards, childcare grants, and rental assistance. Stoker and Wilson break new ground
      by examining the adequacy and coverage of the work support system in all fifty states and the
      District of Columbia. They address the prospects for reforming the system, as well as its
      impact on the politics of redistribution in the United States. Rich in analysis, Wh
      &lt;I&gt;en Work Is Not Enough w&lt;/I&gt;ill be essential reading for anyone interested in
      the impact and future of welfare reform.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Germany and the United States entered the post-9/11 era as
      allies, but they will leave it as partners of convenience &#151;or even possibly as rivals.
      The first comprehensive examination of the German-American relationship written since the
      invasion of Iraq, Parting Ways is indispensable for those seeking to chart the future course
      of the transatlantic alliance. In early 2003, it became apparent that many nations, including
      close allies of the United States, would not participate in the U.S.-led coalition against
      Iraq. Despite the high-profile tension between the United States and France, some of the most
      bitter opposition came from Germany, marking the end not only of the German-American "special
      relationship," but also of the broader transatlantic relationship's preeminence in Western
      strategic thought.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drawing on extensive research and personal interviews
      with decisionmakers and informed observers in both the United States and Germany, Stephen F.
      Szabo frames the clash between Gerhard Schröder and George W. Bush over U.S. policy in Iraq in
      the context of the larger changes shaping the relationship between the two countries. Szabo
      considers such longer-term factors as the decreasing strategic importance of the U.S.-German
      relationship for each nation in the post-cold war era, the emergence of a new German identity
      within Germany itself, and a U.S. foreign policy led by what is arguably the most ideological
      administration of the post-World War II era.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;This volume provides an in-depth examination of six political
      campaigns waged during competitive 1998 races for the U.S. House of Representatives. The case
      studies evaluate the professional political consultants who managed each campaign, their
      interaction with the candidates, and the impact of the campaigns on voters. Relying on
      unparalleled access to both the consultants involved and the candidates themselves, the
      contributors explore the electoral setting and context of the congressional districts, the
      strategy, theme, and message of each campaign, the consultants' decisionmaking, fund-raising,
      and spending, and any outside forces that entered into the races. The book features new data
      on tracking, polls, and television advertising budgets.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;While in the past other emerging powers have used territorial
      expansion or other forms of aggression in order to insert themselves into the international
      arena, China is taking a different road. In this timely collection of speeches, Zheng Bijian,
      one of China's leading thinkers on ideological questions, examines "China's peaceful rise,"
      addressing some of the most complex issues China faces as it emerges into a rapidly changing
      world order. These speeches reflect Zheng's firm sense that the lessons of history demand that
      China pursue a stable, peaceful international environment as a first priority. Such a strategy
      will not only help smooth China's rise &#151;it will also translate China's successes into
      benefits for other countries as well. These speeches are worth reading not only for the
      strength of their ideas, but also for a greater understanding of the political and policy
      constraints and opportunities in relations with China. They help us begin to answer the
      crucial question that informs all these speeches: How should we think about China?&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Relations between the U.S. and Europe have declined in recent
      years, and today they are worse than at any time since the 1950s. In Friendly Fire, a veteran
      reporter known for her shrewd observations of political behavior in Europe examines the
      widening gulf and worsening acrimony between the U.S. and its traditional allies on the
      European continent. Elizabeth Pond examines a number of disputes &#151;chronic trade quarrels,
      the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, Israeli-Palestinian violence, and Iraq
      &#151;and identifies the ways in which they reinforce and exacerbate one another. European
      governments have accepted a rhetorical responsibility for global (and not just European)
      security, but the dearth of defense funding in Europe, disagreements over tactics, and the bad
      American temper toward the Europeans have added to the estrangement.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;America's three most recent wars &#151;in Kosovo, Afghanistan,
      and Iraq &#151;have raised profound questions about when to use military force, for what
      purpose, and who should make the decision whether to go to war. These crucial questions have
      been debated around the world with increasing intensity, and by beginning to provide important
      answers, Beyond Preemption moves the debate forward in significant ways. During the past three
      years, the contributors to this volume have engaged in a global dialogue with political
      officials, military figures and strategists, and international lawyers from around the world
      on when and how to use force and in what way its use can best be legitimized. They found
      consensus that the world has changed so dramatically that much of the old way of thinking
      about when and how to go to use force to deal with new challenges has become largely obsolete.
      Drawing on these high-level discussions, Ivo Daalder and his colleagues make specific
      proposals for how to forge a new international consensus on the vexing questions about the use
      of force, including its preemptive use, to address today's interrelated threats of terrorism,
      weapons of mass destruction, and humanitarian crises. In Beyond Preemption, the authors also
      consider the critical matter of how these strategies could be best legitimized and be made
      palatable to domestic audiences and the international community at large. Contributors include
      Bruce W. Jentleson (Duke University), Anne E. Kramer (Brookings Institution), Susan E. Rice
      (Brookings Institution), James B. Steinberg (Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs,
      University of Texas at Austin).&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Broad-based and inclusive financial systems significantly raise
      growth, alleviate poverty, and expand economic opportunity. Households, small enterprises, and
      the rural poor often have difficulty obtaining financial services for a multitude of reasons,
      including transaction costs, perceived risk, inadequate infrastructure, and information
      barriers. Yet many financial institutions are now making profitable inroads into underserved
      markets through formal banking, investment in equities, venture capital, postal banks, and
      microfinance. Access to Finance addresses the challenges of making financial systems more
      inclusive, emulating successful ventures in new markets, and utilizing technologies and
      government policies to support the expansion of financial access. The contributors examine
      many dimensions of financial access, including: &#149; Measuring financial access &#149;
      Understanding the impact of expanded access &#149; Examining alternative institutional models
      &#149; Exploring new technologies and information infrastructure &#149; Evaluating government
      policies toward outreach.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;This thoughtful volume assesses the likely impact of reformed
      trade policies on the poorest of the poor &#151;those on the bottom economic rungs in
      developing nations. The focus on a spectrum of poor nations across different regions provides
      some helpful and hopeful guidelines regarding the likely impacts of a global trade reform,
      agreed upon under the auspices of the World Trade Organization, as well as the impact of such
      reforms on economic development. In order to facilitate lesson-drawing across different
      regions, each country study utilizes a similar methodology. They combine information on trade
      policy at the product level with income and consumption data at the household level, thus
      capturing effects both on the macro level and in individual households where development
      policies ideally should improve day-to-day life. This uniformity of research approach across
      the country studies allows for a deeper and more robust comparison of results.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;As America's leading expert on the Presidency and an adviser to
      presidents from Harry S Truman to Bill Clinton, Richard E. Neustadt was "the most penetrating
      analyst of power since Machiavelli," as Guardian of the Presidency makes clear. In this
      inspirational book, Neustadt's former colleagues and students celebrate the rich and diverse
      contributions he made to political and academic life in the United States and beyond. JFK
      confidant Ted Sorensen, the late historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Harrison Wellford, formerly
      of the Office of Management and Budget, and Matthew Dickinson focus on his role as a White
      House adviser. Newsweek's Jonathan Alter highlights Neustadt's ability to interpret the
      Presidency for the outside world. Fellow scholars Ernest May, Charles O. Jones, Harvey
      Fineberg, and Graham Allison analyze his legacy as an educator and founding director of
      Harvard's Institute of Politics. Anthony King (Britain at the Polls) and Eric Redman (The
      Dance of Legislation) discuss his work in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Former Vice President
      Al Gore offers an appreciation of Neustadt's influence on generations of students. The book
      concludes with Elizabeth Neustadt's personal reflections about her father.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Standards for education achievement are under scrutiny throughout
      the industrial world. In this technological age, student performance in mathematics is seen as
      being particularly important. For more than four decades, international assessments conducted
      by the International Association for Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) have measured
      how well students are learning mathematics in different countries. The latest round of
      mathematics testing of the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) takes place in
      2007. Beyond the horse race &#151;the rankings that compare nations &#151;what have we learned
      from the wealth of data collected in these assessments? How do US math curriculums compare to
      those used overseas? Is the effect of technology in the classroom uniform across nations? How
      do popular math reforms fare abroad? Those are some of the critical issues tackled in this
      important book. The authors use the database to address several pressing questions about
      school policy and educational research. For example, Ina Mullis and Michael Martin review the
      major lessons learned over the history of TIMSS testing. William Schmidt and Richard T. Houang
      examine whether curricular breadth affects student achievement. Jeremy Kilpatrick, Vilma Mesa,
      and Finbarr Sloane evaluate American performance in algebra relative to other nations and
      pinpoint strengths and weaknesses in American students' learning of algebra.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

      products and exchange-traded funds &#151;and new financial institutions &#151;including hedge
      funds and private-equity funds &#151;present opportunities as well as policy and regulatory
      challenges in U.S. and Japanese financial markets. This book presents cutting-edge research
      from experts in academia and the financial industry on new instruments and new institutions
      while contrasting their developments in the different countries. The contributors highlight
      the innovative way in which Japanese financiers and government officials have learned from the
      U.S. regarding the introduction of new instruments into their market. New Financial
      Instruments and Institutions continues the productive collaboration between the Brookings

      in capital and financial markets. Contributors include Jennifer Bethel (Babson College),Todd

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Indonesia has the fourth largest total population and the largest
      Muslim population of any nation on earth. Indonesia's transition to democracy, thus, is
      critically important at a time when the West's relationship with much of the Muslim world is
      problematic and the push for greater democracy worldwide is a U.S. priority. A major
      impediment to democracy in Indonesia and several other nations is a military establishment
      that is not financially accountable to civilian leaders and thus nearly impossible to control.
      This new study examines what is necessary to bring the Indonesian military "on-budget"
      &#151;what policies are required, what Indonesia can learn from other nations (e.g. China,
      Turkey), &#151;and what a realistic timetable looks like. More than half of what the
      Indonesian armed forces spend is believed to come from sources other than the national budget.
      These sources include a vast array of commercial enterprises, non-profit foundations,
      cooperatives, and rent-seeking activities. Lex Rieffel, who began doing research in Indonesia
      in 1968 and has extensive experience in economic development and international finance issues,
      is impressed by the commitment of Indonesia's new government to reduce the role of the armed
      forces in the economy and make it a fully professional institution. The concise treatment
      considers not only the requirements but also the ramifications of success &#151;or failure
      &#151;in this endeavor and can serve to inform similar efforts in other "democratizing"
      countries, such as Pakistan and Nigeria.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was launched amid
      great hopes and controversy in 1994. More than a dozen years later, progress toward economic
      integration has stalled. Mexico's economy remains far behind those of Canada and the United
      States, and such pressing issues as energy security remain unaddressed. In Requiem or Revival?
      scholars and policymakers from all three nations dissect NAFTA's failure to fulfill its early
      promise and evaluate the prospects for further integration. The authors explore the
      interaction between regionalism and multilateralism, the impact of the "new trade" agenda, and
      NAFTA's unresolved problems &#151;migration, security, and energy. Recognizing the limits of
      the NAFTA framework, they examine its relationship to the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas
      negotiations and the Doha Development Round, and they discuss various ways in which NAFTA
      could be revamped or improved. The result is an intriguing volume offering important insights
      on the future of economic integration in North America and beyond. Contributors include

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;"Iraq is rapidly descending into all-out civil war.
      Unfortunately, the United States probably will not be able to just walk away from the chaos.
      Even setting aside the humanitarian nightmare that will ensue, a full-scale civil war would
      likely consume more than Iraq: historically, such massive conflicts have often had highly
      deleterious effects on neighboring countries and other outside states. Spillover from an Iraq
      civil war could be disastrous." Thus begins this sobering analysis of what the near future of
      Iraq could look like, and what America can do to reduce the threat of wider conflict.
      Preventing spillover of the Iraqi conflict into neighboring states must be a top priority. In
      explaining how that can be accomplished, Daniel Byman and Kenneth Pollack draw on their own
      considerable expertise as well as relevant precedents. The authors scrutinize several recent
      civil wars, including Lebanon, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Bosnia. After synthesizing
      those experiences into lessons on how civil wars affect other nations, Byman and Pollack draw
      from them to produce recommendations for U.S. policy. Even while the Bush Administration
      attempts to prevent further deterioration of the situation in Iraq, it needs to be planning
      how to deal with a full-scale civil war if one develops.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;American voters say they want to hear more about the issues and
      less about partisan politics. An unusually wide-open presidential race presents a unique
      opening for frank discussion and innovative solutions to pressing policy challenges.
      Opportunity 08 takes advantage of this political space to help presidential candidates,
      political observers, and the informed public focus on critical issues facing the nation.
      Opportunity 08 tackles a broad range of issues, organized under three categories: Our World,
      Our Society, and Our Prosperity. On the latter, for example, Brookings scholar Isabel Sawhill
      joins former Congressmen Bill Frenzel (R) and Charles Stenholm (D) and longtime budget counsel
      Bill Hoagland to provide a clear picture of the American budget deficit situation and what
      should be done about it. Sawhill also collaborates with Ron Haskins on a plan to provide
      greater support for education, work, and marriage. Hugh Price puts forth a strategy (and price
      tag) for boosting academic achievement among American schoolchildren. Brookings scholar Henry
      Aaron and Harvard professor Joseph Newhouse describe America's health care predicament and
      discuss options for expanding coverage and reducing costs. Mark McClellan, until recently the
      administrator of Medicare and Medicaid, takes another angle on the same subject, In the realm
      of international affairs, Jeffrey Bader and Richard Bush as well as former Bush administration
      official Michael Green discuss how best to deal with China. Jeremy Shapiro calls for a more
      analytic and threat-based approach to homeland security, arguing that many proposals are too
      ambitious and costly. On the Middle East, Martin Indyk and Tamara Cofman Wittes emphasize the
      need for a moderate coalition that will counter Iran's ambitions in the region, while also
      discussing political reform in Arab states and the Arab-Israeli peace process. Peter Rodman,
      until recently a Bush administration Pentagon official, also addresses the challenge posed by
      a radical Iran. These are just a few of the critical issues and renowned authors included in
      this timely book. Insightful, informed, and independent, Opportunity 08 truly is Brookings at
      its best.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In October 2002 the United States confronted North Korea with
      suspicions that Pyongyang was enriching uranium in violation of the Agreed Framework that the
      nations had worked out during the Clinton administration. North Korea subsequently evicted
      international monitors and resumed its nuclear weapons program. The Peninsula Question
      chronicles the resulting second Korean nuclear crisis. Japanese journalist Yoichi Funabashi,
      informed by interviews with more than 160 diplomats and decision makers from China, Japan,
      Russia, South Korea, and the United States, provides a behind-the-scenes look at the
      negotiations to denuclearize the peninsula. Between 2002 and 2006, a series of top level
      diplomats, including the prime minister of Japan, attempted to engage with North Korea.
      Funabashi illustrates how the individual efforts of these major powers laid the groundwork for
      multilateral negotiations, first as the trilateral meeting and then as the Six-Party Talks.
      The first four rounds of talks (2003&#150;2005) resulted in significant progress.
      Unfortunately, a lack of implementation after that breakthrough ultimately led to North
      Korea's missile tests in July and subsequent nuclear tests in October 2006. Th &lt;I&gt;e
      Peninsula Question p&lt;/I&gt;rovides a window of understanding on the historical,
      geopolitical, and security concerns at play on the Korean peninsula since 2002. Offering
      multiple perspectives on the second Korean nuclear crisis, it describes more than just the
      U.S. and North Korean points of view. It pays special attention to China's dealings with North
      Korea, providing rare insights to into the decision-making processes of Beijing. This is an
      important, authoritative resource for understanding the crisis in Korea and diplomacy in
      Northeast Asia.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;While the high cost of education draws headlines, the cost of not
      educating America's children goes largely ignored. The Price We Pay remedies this oversight by
      highlighting the private and public costs of inadequate education. In this volume, leading
      scholars from a broad range of fields &#151;including economics, education, demography, and
      public health &#151;attach hard numbers to the relationship between educational attainment and
      such critical indicators as income, health, crime, dependence on public assistance, and
      political participation. They explore policy interventions that could boost the education
      system's performance and explain why demographic trends make the challenge of educating our
      youth so urgent today. Improving educational outcomes for at-risk youth is more than a noble
      goal. It is an investment with the potential to yield benefits that far outstrip its costs.
      The Price We Pay provides the tools readers need to analyze both sides of the balance sheet
      and make informed decisions about which policies will pay off. Contributors include Thomas
      Bailey (Teachers College, Columbia University), Ronald F. Ferguson (Harvard University), Irwin

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is the latest in more than
      two decades of federal efforts to raise educational standards and an even longer stream of
      initiatives to improve education for poor children. What lessons can we draw from these
      earlier efforts to help NCLB achieve its goals? In Standards-Based Reform and the Poverty Gap,
      leading scholars in sociology, economics, psychology, and education policy take on this
      critical question. Armed with the latest data and up-to-date research syntheses, the authors
      show that standards-based reform has had some positive effects, particularly in the area of
      teacher quality. Moreover, some of the critics' greatest fears have not been realized: for
      example, retention rates have not shot upward. Yet the overall pace of improvement has been
      slow, owing in part to poor implementation. Based on these findings, the contributors offer
      recommendations for the implementation and impending reauthorization of NCLB. These proposals,
      such as national testing and a rethinking of achievement targets, are sure to be at the center
      of the upcoming debate. Contributors include Thomas Dee, Laura Desimone, George Farkas,
      Barbara Foorman, Brian Jacob, Robert M. Hauser, Paul Hill, Tom Loveless, Meredith Phillips,
      Andrew C. Porter, and Thomas Smith.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
      Change (IPCC) reflects the growing international consensus that the earth's climate is being
      changed by anthropogenic greenhouse gasses. Evidence presented by the IPCC and others points
      to the potential for increasingly dangerous weather, new disease outbreaks, regional water
      shortages, the loss of habitat and species, and other disturbing developments that could have
      profound social and economic impacts. Opinions on what should be done, however, remain sharply
      divided within and among countries. Though monumental in its efforts, the Kyoto Protocol has
      left much to be agreed upon and achieved, with the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide
      &#151;the United States &#151;rejecting it. In G &lt;I&gt;lobal Warming: Looking Beyond Kyoto
      &lt;/I&gt;, some of the best-known and respected authorities in climate policy provide a
      comprehensive agenda for global collective action. Representing both industrialized and
      developing nations, the contributors present a thought-provoking examination of the economic,
      social, and political context of climate policy within their countries. With Kyoto's emissions
      targets set to expire in 2012, these authors call for a multilateral approach that goes beyond
      the mitigation-focused Kyoto policies, balancing them with strategies for adaptation. They
      also stress the importance of generating policies that work within a time frame commensurate
      with that of climate change itself. Informed, insightful, and even-handed, this book gives a
      new impetus to the increasingly important global climate policy debate. Contributors include

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Rental housing is increasingly recognized as a vital housing
      option in the United States. Government policies and programs continue to grapple with
      problematic issues, however, including affordability, distressed urban neighborhoods,
      concentrated poverty, substandard housing stock, and the unmet needs of the disabled, the
      elderly, and the homeless. In R &lt;I&gt;evisiting Rental Housing,&lt;/I&gt; leading housing
      researchers build upon decades of experience, research, and evaluation to inform our
      understanding of the nation's rental housing challenges and what can be done about them. It
      thoughtfully addresses not only present issues affecting rental housing, but also viable
      solutions. The first section reviews the contributing factors and primary problems generated
      by the operation of rental markets. In the second section, contributors dissect how policies
      and programs have &#151;or have not &#151;dealt with the primary challenges; what improvements
      &#151;if any &#151;have been gained; and the lessons learned in the process. The final section
      looks to potential new directions in housing policy, including integrating best practices from
      past lessons into existing programs, and new innovations for large-scale, long-term market and
      policy solutions that get to the root of rental housing challenges. Contributors include

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The Innovations in American Government Awards Program began in
      1985 with a grant from the Ford Foundation to the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard to
      conduct a program of awards for innovations in state and local government. The foundation's
      objective was ambitious and, in an era of "government is the problem" rhetoric, determinedly
      proactive. It sought to counter declining public confidence in government by highlighting
      innovative and effective programs. Over twenty years later, research, recognition, and
      replication are the source of the program's continuing influence and its vitality. What is the
      future of government innovation? How can innovation enhance the quality of life for citizens
      and strengthen democratic governance? Innovations in Government: Research, Recognition, and
      Replication answers these questions by presenting a comprehensive approach to advancing the
      practice and study of innovation in government. The authors discuss new research on
      innovation, explore the impact of several programs that recognize innovation, and consider
      challenges to the replication of innovations. Contributors include Eugene Bardach (University
      of California&#150; Berkeley), Robert Behn (Harvard University), John D. Donahue (Harvard
      University), Marta Ferreira Santos Farah (Center for Public Administration and Government,

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Slow job growth, declining home values, a diminishing tax base,
      and concentrated poverty are but a few of the growing obstacles for well-established but
      struggling cities. Challenged by decades of globalization, technological change, and dramatic
      demographic shifts away from the urban core, these former industrial powerhouses, particularly
      in the Northeast and Midwest, have been eclipsed by burgeoning American cities with a viable
      niche in the new economy. In R &lt;I&gt;etooling for Growth,&lt;/I&gt; experts present new
      frameworks, cutting-edge analysis, and innovative policy solutions for the nation's
      government, business, civic, and community leaders to sculpt a sustainable and supportable
      economy for older industrial areas. The unique focus on rehabilitating weak market cities
      outlines ideas for reshaping the role of public agencies, the workforce, business
      organizations, and technology. Implementation of these measures addresses challenges such as
      fostering entrepreneurship, reducing poverty and inequality, and maintaining and augmenting
      the number of skilled professionals who reside and work in a community, among others. This
      collection of essays offers practical, achievable strategies for revitalizing industrial areas
      and building upon the potential of existing but overlooked resources of economic, physical,
      and cultural significance. In this important volume, leading authorities provide a
      thought-provoking analysis of healthy economic development practices for both public and
      private sectors.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Aviation performance is an important cog in modern globalized
      economies, which demand flexibility, mobility, efficiency, and dependability. Airport delays
      have gone from being a nuisance to being a salient public concern, drawing the ire of even the
      White House. In this important book, international transportation experts compare and contrast
      how different nations have managed their airports and air traffic control systems and how well
      they are meeting the needs of their people. The book's cross-national approach encompasses
      several different institutional arrangements, making it a timely and valuable study in
      comparative political economy. Among the countries studied, the United States is sometimes
      seen as a bastion of free markets, at the forefront of airline deregulation, but its airports
      and air traffic control system are publicly owned and operated. The same is true in
      continental Europe, for the most part. In contrast, Australia, New Zealand, the United
      Kingdom, and Canada are experimenting with privatization, while even mainland China is
      allowing the private sector to participate in airport ownership. Which methods work best, and
      under what circumstances? This book provides the answers.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;President Bush promised to democratize the Middle East, but the
      results so far have dispirited democracy advocates and brought their project into disrepute.
      After the debacle in Iraq and the electoral success of Hamas, the pursuit of Arab democracy
      seems to many observers a fool's errand, an unfortunate combination of ideology and wishful
      thinking. In F &lt;I&gt;reedom's Unsteady March &lt;/I&gt;, Tamara Cofman Wittes dissects the
      Bush administration's failure to advance freedom in the Middle East and lays out a better
      strategy for future efforts to promote democracy. Wittes argues that only the development of a
      more liberal and democratic politics in the Arab world will secure America's long-term goals
      in the region and that America must continue trying to foster progress in that direction. To
      do so, however, it must confront more honestly the risks of change and act more effectively to
      contain them. A dangerous combination of growing populations, economic stagnation, and
      political alienation poses the primary threat to Middle East stability today, severely testing
      the legitimacy and governability of key states such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. If Arab
      governments cannot sustain the support of their citizens, they will find it difficult to work
      with America on issues of common concern such as stabilizing Iraq, confronting Iran on nuclear
      weapons, and promoting Arab-Israeli peace. Despite President Bush's failures, Wittes argues,
      the United States cannot afford to ignore the momentous social, economic, and political
      changes already taking place in Arab states. Wittes' detailed analysis of Arab politics and
      American policy presents an alternative &#151;in her view, the only alternative: overcoming
      America's deep ambivalence about Arab democracy to support positive, liberal change in the
      region that will create a firmer foundation for Arab-American ties.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Democracy in the States&lt;/I&gt; offers a 21st century
      agenda for election reform in America based on lessons learned in the fifty states. Combining
      accessibility and rigor, leading scholars of U.S. politics and elections examine the impact of
      reforms intended to increase the integrity, fairness, and responsiveness of the electoral
      system. While some of these reforms focus on election administration, which has been the
      subject of much controversy since the 2000 presidential election, others seek more broadly to
      increase political participation and improve representation. For example, Paul Gronke (Reed
      College) and his colleagues study the relationship between early voting and turnout. Barry
      Burden (University of Wisconsin&#150;Madison) examines the hurdles that third-party candidates
      must clear to get on the ballot in different states. Michael McDonald (George Mason
      University) analyzes the leading strategies for redistricting reform. And Todd Donovan
      (Western Washington University) focuses on how the spread of "safe" legislative seats affects
      both representation and participation. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously observed
      that "a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try
      novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country." Nowhere is
      this function more essential than in the sphere of election reform, as this important book
      shows.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The global climate change problem has finally entered the world's
      consciousness. While efforts to find a solution have increased momentum, international
      attention has focused primarily on the industrial and energy sectors. The forest, and land-use
      sector, however, remains one of the most significant untapped opportunities for carbon
      mitigation. The expiration of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period in 2012 presents an
      opportunity for the international community to put this sector back on the
      agenda.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this timely, wide-ranging volume, an international team of
      experts explain the links between climate change and forests, highlighting the potential
      utility of this sector within emerging climate policy frameworks and carbon markets. After
      framing forestry activities within the larger context of climate-change policy, the
      contributors analyze the operation and efficacy of market-based mechanisms for forest
      conservation and climate change. Drawing on experiences from around the world, the authors
      present concrete recommendations for policymakers, project developers, and market
      participants. They discuss sequestration rights in Chile, carbon offset programs in Australia
      and New Zealand, and emerging policy incentives at all levels of the U.S. government. The book
      also explores the different voluntary schemes for carbon crediting, provides an overview of
      best practices in carbon accounting, and presents tools for use in future sequestration and
      offset programs. It concludes with consideration of various incentive options for slowing
      deforestation and protecting the world's remaining forests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
      &lt;I&gt;Climate Change and Forests&lt;/I&gt; provides a realistic view of the role that the
      forest and land-use sector can play in a post-Kyoto regime. It will serve as a practical
      reference manual for anyone concerned about climate policy, including the negotiators working
      to define a robust and enduring international framework for addressing climate
      change.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Alliance Curse&lt;/I&gt;, Hilton Root illustrates
      that recent U.S. foreign policy is too often misguided, resulting in misdirected foreign aid
      and alliances that stunt political and economic development among partner regimes, leaving
      America on the wrong side of change. Many alliances with third world dictators, ostensibly of
      mutual benefit, reduce incentives to govern for prosperity and produce instead political and
      social instability and economic failure. Yet again, in the war on terror and in the name of
      preserving global stability, America is backing authoritarian regimes that practice repression
      and plunder. It is as if the cold war never ended. While espousing freedom and democracy, the
      U.S. contradicts itself by aiding governments that do not share those values. In addition to
      undercutting its own stated goal of promoting freedom, America makes the developing world even
      more wary of its intentions. Yes, the democracy we preach arouses aspirations and attracts
      immigrants, but those same individuals become our sternest critics; having learned to admire
      American values, they end up deploring U.S. policies toward their own countries. Long-term
      U.S. security is jeopardized by a legacy of resentment and distrust. A &lt;I&gt;lliance Curse
      &lt;/I&gt;proposes an analytical foundation for national security that challenges long-held
      assumptions about foreign affairs. It questions the wisdom of diplomacy that depends on
      questionable linkages or outdated suppositions. The end of the Soviet Union did not portend
      the demise of communism, for example. Democracy and socialism are not incompatible systems.
      Promoting democracy by linking it with free trade risks overemphasizing the latter goal at the
      expense of the former. The growing tendency to play China against India in an effort to retain
      American global supremacy will hamper relations with both &#151;an intolerable situation in
      today's interdependent world. Root buttresses his analysis with case studies of American
      foreign policy toward developing countries (e.g., Vietnam), efforts at state building, and
      nations growing in importance, such as China. He concludes with a series of recommendations
      designed to close the gap between security and economic development.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Since its launch in 2006, the Hamilton Project at Brookings has
      produced extensive research on how to create a growing economy that benefits all Americans.
      Its pragmatic work aims to increase opportunities for broad-based wealth, economic security,
      and enduring growth. Path to Prosperity, the first book to emerge from the Hamilton Project,
      presents important and original work to that end. P &lt;I&gt;ath to Prosperity
      &lt;/I&gt;focuses on three key criteria for fostering broadly shared economic growth:
      enhancing economic security, building a highly skilled work force, and reforming the tax
      system. Income security proposals offer methods for reforming unemployment insurance,
      protecting against the risk of reemployment at a lower wage after job loss, and improving
      incentives for retirement saving. Education proposals build human capital by improving each
      level of education, from preschool programs for poor children to graduate fellowships in math
      and science. The tax proposals seek to make taxation simpler, more progressive, and better
      suited to a global economy. Contributors include Roger C.Altman, Reuven S.Avi-Yonah, Jason E.

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Global climate change poses not only environmental hazards but
      profound risks to planetary peace and stability as well. Climatic Cataclysm gathers experts on
      climate science, oceanography, history, political science, foreign policy, and national
      security to take the measure of these risks. The contributors have developed three scenarios
      of what the future may hold. The expected scenario relies on current scientific models to
      project the effects of climate change over the next 30 years. The severe scenario, which
      posits a much stronger climate response to current levels of carbon loading, foresees profound
      and potentially destabilizing global effects over the next generation or more. Finally, the
      catastrophic scenario is characterized by a devastating "tipping point" in the climate system,
      perhaps 50 or 100 years hence. In this future world, the land-based polar ice sheets have
      disappeared, global sea levels have risen dramatically, and the existing natural order has
      been destroyed beyond repair. The contributors analyze the security implications of these
      scenarios, which at a minimum include increased disease proliferation; tensions caused by
      large-scale migration; and conflict sparked by resource scarcity, particularly in Africa. They
      consider what we can learn from the experience of early civilizations confronted with natural
      disaster, and they ask what the three largest emitters of greenhouse gases &#151;the United
      States, the European Union, and China &#151;can do to reduce and manage future risks. In the
      coming decade, the United States faces an ominous set of foreign policy and national security
      challenges. Global climate change will not only complicate these tasks, but as this sobering
      study reveals, it may also create new challenges that dwarf those of today. Contributors
      include Leon Fuerth (George Washington University), Jay Gulledge (Pew Center on Global Climate
      Change), Alexander T. J. Lennon (Center for Strategic and International Studies), J.R. McNeill
      (Georgetown University), Derek Mix (Center for Strategic and International Studies), Peter

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The goal of this book, the first in a series, is to bring
      policymakers, practitioners, and scholars up to speed on the state of knowledge on various
      aspects of urban and regional policy. What do we know about the effectiveness of select policy
      approaches, reforms, or experiments on key social and economic problems facing cities,
      suburbs, and metropolitan areas? What can we say about what works, what doesn't, and why? And
      what does this knowledge and experience imply for future policy questions? The authors take a
      fresh look at several different issues (e.g., economic development, education, land use) and
      conceptualize how each should be thought of. Once the contributors have presented the essence
      of what is known, as well as the likely implications, they identify the knowledge gaps that
      need to be filled for the successful formulation and implementation of urban and regional
      policy.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In recent years the Russian government, concerned about
      sustaining its economic performance, has sought to promote more diversified and broader
      economic growth beyond the profitable natural-resource sector. Economic officials would like
      to see something closer to a "knowledge-based economy." One of the areas in clear need of
      upgrading is the manufacturing sector. This book quantifies and benchmarks the relative
      strengths of that sector, identifying opportunities to increase Russian productivity and
      competitiveness. Drawing on original survey data from Russian firms of all sizes, the authors
      formulate proposals that aim to &#149; enhance the innovative potential of Russian firms,
      &#149; upgrade the skills of their workforce, and &#149; develop a business-friendly climate
      of lower administrative costs and greater policy certainty. This book examines the underlying
      firm-level determinants of knowledge absorption, competitiveness, and productivity, with an
      eye to improving workers' skill levels and improving the investment climate, which should in
      turn enhance the innovation needed to keep up in a globalized economy. The original research
      and analysis of Desai, Goldberg, and their colleagues will be of use to anyone interested in
      the problems of building manufacturing competitiveness, especially in Russia and the
      post-Soviet transition economies. It will also be of interest to organizations planning to do
      business with Russia or to invest in it.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;One of the first rules of investing is diversification: spreading
      resources over many types of investments in order to minimize financial risk. Mutual funds
      have been the diversification vehicle of choice for the last several decades. In recent years,
      however, other opportunities for diversification &#151;such as separately managed accounts and
      exchange-traded funds &#151;have enjoyed rapid growth. What lies ahead for the mutual fund
      industry in light of this increasingly competitive environment? In this volume, experts from
      the United States and Japan look at forces of change in their securities markets and offer
      their views of the future for mutual funds and other forms of securities diversification.

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Vital Statistics on Congress&lt;/I&gt; remains the
      quintessential source of authoritative information on America's legislature. This important
      series tracks the elements that define and describe Congress in the post&#150;World War II
      era, and in this new edition, three of America's most esteemed political analysts extend their
      examination through the 109th Congress. They combine historical context with insightful
      analysis and copious data to produce a valuable and authoritative picture of the U.S. Senate
      and House of Representatives. Norman Ornstein, Thomas Mann, and Michael Malbin track the
      changing makeup of Congress through history and across several dimensions, such as region,
      party, occupation, religion, committee assignments, staff size, and political stances. They
      document trends in critical areas such as voter turnout, ticket splitting, incumbency and
      turnover, and margin of victory. The authors, acknowledged experts in campaign finance,
      provide detailed information on candidate, party, and PAC spending. The material presented in
      l &lt;I&gt;Statistics on Congress 2008 rev r&lt;/I&gt;eveals a fascinating and important
      picture of America's chosen representatives, as politicians and as people. It will be an
      important addition to the bookshelves of media, political professionals, scholars and their
      students, and political junkies everywhere.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;With every new presidential administration, thousands of highly
      accomplished individuals face one of the greatest challenges of their lives: learning to
      become an effective presidential appointee. This handbook will help ease that task. In clear,
      crisp language, punctuated by numerous examples, Edward DeSeve explains the ten core
      competencies that distinguish successful presidential appointees. These skills and abilities
      range from personal dedication to public service and the ability to manage change to global
      awareness. In illustrating these concepts, DeSeve draws on ideas developed by scholars of
      public and business management, as well as his many years of government service. Equally
      important, he presents a guide to the key terms, laws, and regulations that new appointees
      will have to deal with once in office. Not surprisingly, presidential appointees have
      typically been successful in their professional lives. These are people accustomed to getting
      things done. But for many of them, the federal government constitutes a brave new world, full
      of daunting challenges and potential pitfalls. The Presidential Appointee's Handbook will help
      them find their footing and effectively formulate, implement, and enforce the policies of the
      president at whose pleasure they serve. It will also help political observers grasp more fully
      the enormity of installing and operating a new government.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Americans are awash in debt, and the U.S. economy is in trouble.
      Credit undergirds daily life more than ever &#151;it has become one of the defining aspects of
      American life, and the ramifications are becoming clearer by the day. The already considerable
      damage from a depressed housing market has been exacerbated by the subprime lender implosion,
      sending shock waves through the financial sector, international economies, and government at
      all levels. Most low- or moderate-income people borrow, but that should not be construed as
      uniformly poor judgment or lack of disciplines &#151;Americans are not borrowing merely to
      keep up with the Joneses, but too often simply to stay afloat.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In
      &lt;I&gt;Borrowing to Live&lt;/I&gt;, the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard
      University brings together a group of experts drawn from the best of academia, research, and
      public services. Together with editors Nicolas Retsinas and Eric Belsky, they dissect the
      worrisome current state of consumer and mortgage credit in the United States and help point
      the way out of the current struggles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors: Michael S. Barr, Eric S.

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;This book documents a worrisome gap between principles and
      practice in democratic governance. The State of Access is a comparative, cross-disciplinary
      exploration of the ways in which democratic institutions fail or succeed to create the equal
      opportunities that they have promised to deliver to the people they serve. In theory, rules
      and regulations may formally guarantee access to democratic processes, public services, and
      justice. But reality routinely disappoints, for a number of reasons &#151;exclusionary
      policymaking, insufficient attention to minorities, underfunded institutions, inflexible
      bureaucracies. The State of Access helps close the gap between the potential and performance
      in democratic governance.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Because of its potential impact, and, in some cases, the harm it
      has brought, foreign aid is under the microscope. Donor countries, who don't want simply to
      give money away; recipient nations, who need to make the most of what they have and get; and
      analysts, policymakers, and writers are all scrutinizing how much is spent and where it goes.
      Perhaps more important, aid is only a small part of what developing country governments spend.
      Their own resources finance 80 percent or more of health and education spending except in the
      most aid-dependent countries. &lt;I&gt;Lives in the Balance&lt;/I&gt; investigates a vital
      aspect of this landscape &#151;how best to ensure that public spending, including aid money,
      gets to the right destination. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The development of democratic institutions
      and the spread of cheap communications technology in developing countries make it possible for
      the "demand-side" &#151;citizens and civil society institutions &#151;to advocate for improved
      transparency, stronger accountability, better priorities, reduced corruption, and more
      emphasis on helping the poor. Securing real reform will depend not only on knowledge of how
      the recipient government operates, but also how to work with partner entities &#151;the media,
      the private sector, other organizations, and legislators &#151;to raise awareness and compel
      change.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;This translation of the French bestseller &lt;I&gt;Continuer
      l'Histoire&lt;/I&gt; brings the powerful, articulate message of Hubert Védrine to an even
      wider audience. With the astute analysis and acerbic wit for which he is famous, the former
      French foreign minister offers an overview of world politics since the fall of the Berlin
      Wall. Critical of both the United States and Europe, he calls for a return to a more realist
      foreign policy, rejecting the ideological notions of recent years. In s &lt;I&gt;tory Strikes
      Back: How States, Nations, and Conflicts Are Shaping the 21st Century, ,&lt;/I&gt; Védrine
      takes issue with idealists who believe that states are no longer necessary and that
      globalization and free markets will automatically make a better world for all. Far from having
      ended, history continues to present major challenges. When the Eastern bloc collapsed, the
      West was quick to believe that it had won the battle of history and that its values would
      prevail everywhere. The ensuing years have belied that faith, however. In dealing with a newly
      multipolar world, Americans have been too bellicose and Europeans naïve. Védrine shows why
      Westerners need to discard the illusions that have guided their international relations for
      more than twenty years. He presents a realistic vision for building a better world and spells
      out what Europeans expect from the U.S. administration to come. The United States and Europe
      must partner for a new form of "smart Realpolitik" to guide their relations with emerging
      powers, manage globalization, and deal with environmental challenges.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;New presidents have no honeymoon when it comes to foreign policy.
      Less than three months into his presidency, for example, John F. Kennedy authorized the
      disastrous effort to overthrow Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs. More recently, George W. Bush
      had been in office for less than eight months when he was faced with the attacks of September
      11. How should an incoming president prepare for the foreign policy challenges that lie
      immediately ahead? That's the question Kurt Campbell and James Steinberg tackle in this
      compelling book. Drawing on their decades of government service &#151;in the corridors of
      Capitol Hill, the intimate confines of the White House, the State Department, and the
      bare-knuckles Pentagon bureaucracy &#151;Campbell and Steinberg identify the major foreign
      policy pitfalls that face a new presidential administration. They explain clearly and
      concisely what it takes to get foreign policy right from the start. The authors set the scene
      with a historical overview of presidential transitions and foreign policy including case
      studies of such prominent episodes as the "Black Hawk Down" tragedy in Somalia that shook the
      Clinton administration in its first year and the Bush administration's handling of the
      collision between a U.S. reconnaissance plane and a Chinese fighter jet in the spring of 2001.
      They pinpoint the leading causes of foreign policy fiascos, including the tendency to write
      off the policies of the outgoing administration and the failure to appreciate the differences
      between campaign promises and policy realities. Most important, they provide a road map to
      help the new administration steer clear of the land mines ahead. America's next president will
      confront critical foreign policy decisions from day one. Dif &lt;I&gt;ficult Transitions
      pr&lt;/I&gt;ovides essential guidance for getting those choices right.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Contrary to popular belief, the problem with U.S. higher
      education is not too much politics but too little. Far from being bastions of liberal bias,
      American universities have largely withdrawn from the world of politics. So conclude Bruce L.
      R. Smith, Jeremy Mayer, and Lee Fritschler in this illuminating book. C &lt;I&gt;losed Minds?
      d &lt;/I&gt;draws on data from interviews, focus groups, and a new national survey by the
      authors, as well as their decades of experience in higher education to paint the most
      comprehensive picture to date of campus political attitudes. It finds that while liberals
      outnumber conservatives within faculty ranks, even most conservatives believe that ideology
      has little impact on hiring and promotion. Today's students are somewhat more conservative
      than their professors, but few complain of political bias in the classroom. Similarly, a
      Pennsylvania legislative inquiry, which the authors explore as a case study of conservative
      activism in higher education, found that political bias was "rare" in the state's public
      colleges and universities. Yet this ideological peace on campus has been purchased at a high
      price. American universities are rarely hospitable to lively discussions of issues of public
      importance. They largely shun serious political debate, all but ignore what used to be called
      civics, and take little interest in educating students to be effective citizens. Smith, Mayer,
      and Fritschler contrast the current climate of disengagement with the original civic mission
      of American colleges and universities. In concluding, they suggest how universities can
      reclaim and strengthen their place in the nation's political and civic life.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The next U.S. president will need to pursue a new strategic
      framework for advancing American interests in the Middle East. The mounting challenges include
      sectarian conflict in Iraq, Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities, failing Palestinian and
      Lebanese governments, a dormant peace process, and the ongoing war against terror. Compounding
      these challenges is a growing hostility toward U.S. involvement in the Middle East. The old
      policy paradigms, whether President George W. Bush's model of regime change and
      democratization or President Bill Clinton's model of peacemaking and containment, will no
      longer suit the likely circumstances confronting the next administration in the Middle East.
      In R &lt;I&gt;estoring the Balance,&lt;/I&gt; experts from the Saban Center at the Brookings
      Institution and from the Council on Foreign Relations propose a new, nonpartisan strategy
      drawing on the lessons of past failures to address both the short-term and long-term
      challenges to U.S. interests. Following an overview chapter by Richard N. Haass, president of
      the Council on Foreign Relations, and Martin Indyk, director of the Saban Center, individual
      chapters address the Arab-Israeli conflict, counterterrorism, Iran, Iraq, political and
      economic development, and nuclear proliferation. Specific policy recommendations stem from
      in-depth research and extensive dialogue with individuals in government, media, academia, and
      the private sector throughout the region. The experts include Stephen Biddle, Isobel Coleman,
      Steven A. Cook, Steven Simon, and Ray Takeyh from the Council on Foreign Relations and Daniel
      L. Byman, Suzanne Maloney, Kenneth M. Pollack, Bruce Riedel, ShibleyTelhami, and Tamara Cofman
      Wittes from Brookings' Saban Center.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;For decades, the federal government's failure to provide decent
      and affordable housing to very low-income families has given rise to severely distressed urban
      neighborhoods that defeat the best hopes of both residents and local officials. Now, however,
      there is cause for optimism. &lt;I&gt;From Despair to Hope&lt;/I&gt; documents the evolution
      of HOPE VI, a federal program that promotes mixed-income housing integrated with services and
      amenities to replace the economically and socially isolated public housing complexes of the
      past. As one of the most ambitious urban development initiatives in the last half century,
      HOPE VI has transformed the landscape in Atlanta, Baltimore, Louisville, Seattle, and other
      cities, providing vivid examples of a true federal-urban partnership and offering lessons for
      policy innovators. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;From Despair to Hope&lt;/I&gt;, Henry
      Cisneros and Lora Engdahl collaborate with public and private sector leaders who were on the
      scene in the early 1990s when the intolerable conditions in the nation's worst public housing
      projects &#151;and their devastating impact on inhabitants, neighborhoods, and cities
      &#151;called for drastic action. These eyewitnesses from the policymaking, housing
      development, and architecture fields reveal how a program conceived to address one specific
      problem revolutionized the entire public housing system and solidified a set of principles
      that guide urban policy today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This vibrant, full-color exploration of HOPE
      VI details the fate of residents, neighborhoods, cities, and public housing systems through
      personal testimony, interviews, case studies, data analyses, research summaries, photographs,
      and more. Contributors examine what HOPE VI has accomplished as it brings disadvantaged
      families into more economically mixed communities. They also turn a critical eye on where the
      program falls short of its ideals. This important book continues the national conversation on
      poverty, race, and opportunity as the country moves ahead under a new president.
      &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Highlights from &lt;I&gt;From Despair to
      Hope&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;/I&gt;"For far too long, the government's response to the condition
      of public housing was predictable and uncreative.... However, under HOPE VI, things began to
      change. The program reflected a new view &#151;that cities were centers of opportunity and not
      just massive shelters for the poor." from the Foreword by Kurt L. Schmoke, Dean of Howard
      University School of Law and former Mayor of Baltimore "HOPE VI arose during a period of
      intense urban crisis in the United States that gave rise to the consensus that the extreme
      poverty in the inner cities and large public housing projects was intolerable. The
      prescription offered by HOPE VI... reflected the bold notion that public housing needed not
      merely to provide affordable shelter, but also to generate broader community revival and to
      alleviate poverty." Bruce Katz&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"The benefits of public housing redevelopment
      &#151;when thoughtfully planned and effectively implemented &#151;can spill over to help turn
      around long-neglected neighborhoods, attracting new residents and new investments that
      strengthen a city's social and fiscal health." Margery Austin Turner&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"When
      public housing residents are integrated into mixed-income communities, those communities can
      fulfill multiple roles that are crucial to the urban workforce, to the housing mission of
      cities, and to the metropolitan economy." Henry G. Cisneros&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"Mounting
      evidence on the extraordinary personal, social, and economic costs of polarization by race and
      income supports continued efforts to strive for... a new national policy for metropolitan
      development." G. Thomas Kingsley&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors: Richard D. Baron (McCormack

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The economic growth of China is clearly one of the defining
      trends of our time. The world's most populous nation is undergoing a vast transformation that
      will redefine the global economy. Chinese industrial production has increased tremendously in
      recent years, and its consumption of resources has necessarily gone way up as well. These
      developments will have important impacts on economics, business, politics, and environmental
      conditions throughout the world. In C &lt;I&gt;hina's Dilemma: Economic Growth, the
      Environment, and Climate Change,&lt;/I&gt; an international group of authorities examines the
      present status and likely future of China's economic rise and its impact on the environment,
      with particular focus on the all-important topic of global climate change. The first section
      addresses directly China's recent growth. Specific topics addressed here include the effects
      on China of the global credit crunch, determinants of growth, and their prospects for the
      future. Part II addresses China's environmental and climate concerns, including the impact on
      human health, their role in domestic politics, the health effects of environmental damage, and
      China's post- Kyoto climate strategy. Part III looks at the impact, and likely trajectory, of
      energy consumption in China. Contents Part I. Economic Growth: Determinants and Prospects
      Includes introduction Part II. Impact of Environment Degradation and Climate Change Part III.

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Few people realize that one of the nation's largest health
      programs runs through the tax system. Reformers of all stripes propose to modify current tax
      rules as part of larger programs to increase coverage and control costs. Is the current system
      working? Will tax-based reforms achieve their goals? Several of the nation's foremost experts
      on taxation and health policy address these questions in Using Taxes to Reform Health
      Insurance, a joint product of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and the American Tax
      Policy Institute. Led by respected economists Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution and
      Leonard Burman of the Urban Institute, contributors examine the role taxes currently play, the
      likely effects of recently introduced health savings accounts, the challenges of administering
      major subsidies for health insurance through the tax system, and options for using the tax
      system to expand health insurance coverage. No taxpayer or consumer of health care services
      can afford to ignore these issues.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution was established
      to foster policy innovation from leading economic thinkers &#151;ideas based on evidence and
      experience, not ideology and doctrine. The overall goal is to promote America's long-term
      economic growth, and economic security for American families. This important book brings The
      Hamilton Project's approach to one of the most critical issues facing Americans today
      &#151;health care.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Who Has the Cure?&lt;/I&gt; a team of noted
      economists and policy analysts emphasizes the importance of universal health care &#151;not
      just its value to individual and families, but also the overall economy. They examine in
      detail four policy alternatives for achieving universal health insurance coverage that would
      also improve efficiency in the health care industry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The contributors to
      this volume also evaluate proposales designed to make health care more affordable and
      effective. Among the possible strategies studied here are an expansion of preventive care,
      income-related cost sharing, and reform of Medicare's prescription drug benefit.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Plug-in electric vehicles are coming. Major automakers plan to
      commercialize their first models soon, while Israel and Denmark have ambitious plans to
      electrify large portions of their vehicle fleets. No technology has greater potential to end
      the United States' crippling dependence on oil, which leaves the nation vulnerable to price
      shocks, supply disruptions, environmental degradation, and national security threats including
      terrorism. What does the future hold for this critical technology, and what should the U.S.
      government do to promote it? &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hybrid vehicles now number more than one
      million on America's roads, and they are in high demand from consumers. The next major
      technological step is the plug-in electric vehicle. It combines an internal combustion engine
      and electric motor, just as hybrids do. But unlike their precursors, PEVs can be recharged
      from standard electric outlets, meaning the vehicles would no longer be dependent on oil.
      Widespread growth in the use of PEVs would dramatically reduce oil dependence, cut driving
      costs and reduce pollution from vehicles. National security would be enhanced, as reduced oil
      dependence decreases the leverage and resources of petroleum exporters.
      &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Brookings fellow David Sandalow heads up an authoritative team of experts
      including former government officials, private-sector analysts, academic experts, and
      nongovernmental advocates. Together they explain the current landscape for PEVs: the
      technology, the economics, and the implications for national security and the environment.
      They examine how the national interest could be served by federal promotion and investment in
      PEVs. For example, can tax or procurement policy advance the cause of PEVs? Should the public
      sector contribute to greater research and development? Should the government insist on PEVs to
      replenish its huge fleet of official vehicles?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Plug-in electric vehicles are
      coming. But how soon, in what numbers, and to what effect? Federal policies in the years ahead
      will go a long way toward answering those questions. David Sandalow and his colleagues examine
      what could be done in that regard, as well as what should be done.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The Obama administration inherits a daunting set of domestic and
      international policy challenges. It would be tempting to put Latin America and the Caribbean
      on the back burner, for their nations pose no imminent security threat nor do they seem at
      first blush critical to the most pressing problems of U.S. foreign policy. &lt;I&gt;The Obama
      Administration and the Americas&lt;/I&gt;, however, argues that the new administration should
      focus early and strategically on Latin America.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our neighbors to the south
      impact daily on the lives of U.S. citizens, on issues such as energy, narcotics, immigration,
      trade, and jobs. And these are the countries most likely to partner with Washington on the
      basis of shared values, culture, and interests. Recognized experts from Latin America, the
      United States, and Europe suggest in this timely volume that the United States should seize an
      early opportunity to engage Latin America, recognizing the region's diversity but also its
      shared concerns and aspirations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The consolidation of stable democracies and
      rule of law in Latin America has long been an expressed goal of both parties in Washington,
      but the backlash from Iraq, the global financial crisis, and other recent experiences may
      discourage the use of U.S. influence and assistance to nurture democratic governance. The
      authors emphasize case-by-case, sophisticated, and multilateral approaches to dealing with
      such hard cases as Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, Haiti, Mexico, and Venezuela.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In recent years, the developing world has seen a burst of efforts
      to reduce corruption, increase transparency and accountability, and improve governance.
      Needless to say, this is an important and encouraging development. However, the lack of a
      reliable compass to describe where a country is at a given moment &#151;and where it could be
      heading in the absence or acceptance of proposed reforms &#151;can result in disastrous
      missteps. The unfortunate absence of such a guide has helped lead to innumerable failed
      governments or ineffective regimes. This important book aims to fill that
      void.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;How to Improve Governance&lt;/I&gt; emphasizes the need for
      an overall analytical framework that can be applied to different countries to help analyze
      their current situations, identify potential areas for improvement, and assess their relative
      feasibility and the steps needed to promote them. A country-specific analysis needs to be
      comprehensive, in the sense that it includes the four concepts of transparency,
      accountability, governance, and anticorruption throughout the calculus. Without such an
      analytic framework, any reform attempt is likely to flounder for lack of a shared
      understanding of the underlying problems and of the feasible reforms. The book gives special
      emphasis to the potential for civil society groups to play a stronger role in holding
      governments accountable for their use of public resources, and to the importance of developing
      politically feasible, prioritized country strategies for reform.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"Whether
      one looks at how to increase domestic demand for good governance, how to make government more
      accountable to the public, or how to build democratic processes that deliver results, the
      underlying issues are essentially the same.... As development actors of various types... seek
      to help, more and more of them are calling for a clearer conceptual framework to guide their
      efforts." &#151;From the Introduction&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Urban and Regional Policy and Its Effects&lt;/I&gt;,
      the second in a series, sets out to inform policymakers, practitioners, and scholars about the
      effectiveness of select policy approaches, reforms, and experiments in addressing key social
      and economic problems facing cities, suburbs, and metropolitan areas. The chapters analyze
      responses to six key policy challenges that most metropolitans areas and local communities
      face:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#149; Creating quality neighborhoods for
      families&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#149; Governing effectively&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#149; Building
      human capital&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#149; Growing the middle class&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#149;
      Growing a competitive economy through industry-based strategies&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#149;
      Managing the spatial pattern of metropolitan growth and development&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each
      chapter discusses a specific policy topic under one of these challenges. The authors present
      the essence of what is known, as well as the likely implications, and identify the knowledge
      gaps that need to be filled for the successful formulation and implementation of urban and
      regional policy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors: Karen Chapple and Rick Jacobus (University of

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;While much foreign aid achieves commendable goals, some is
      ineffective. In this volume, Clifford Zinnes argues that a donor's intrinsic informational
      limitations on the local context as well as inability to control the progress of interventions
      mean that lack of success is not rooting in insufficient funding but in maladapted institution
      designs of interventions that don't foster local ownership. He indentifies and assesses a
      newly emerging class of foreign aid delivery that promises to overcome these obstacles. The
      approach is based on "prospective inter-jurisdictional competition" (PIJC). Beneficiary groups
      &#151;often local-level governments, supported by their private sector and civil society
      &#151;act as teams and compete against each other under explicit predefined rules and
      objectives to design and implement interventions under their own aegis to achieve the highest
      quantitatively measured performance, either relative to others ("tournaments") or against a
      preset benchmark ("certification"). Teams that cooperate internally are the likeliest to win
      the rewards, which, aside from the longer run benefits of the intervention itself, might
      include more substantive financial or technical assitance from the
      sponsor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since only groups serious about reforming choose to play, Zinnes
      says the incentives generated by the ensuing "race-to-the-top" competitiion create local
      ownership, encouraging recipients to draw on their own knowledge. Moreover, since all teams
      that compete &#151;and not just those who "win" donor rewards &#151;benefit from their own
      reform efforts, he argues that this approach can leverage aid resources more than a
      conventional bilateral aid agreement. Zinnes presents a dozen recent applications of the
      approach, including those sponsored by the World Bank, USAID, the United Nations, the Ford
      Foundation, and others. He also recommends improvements and ways to scale up PIJC-based
      projects in applications ranging from protecting the environment and reducing red tape through
      to raising literacy and co-opting warlords.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Once we paid for things with bills, coins, or checks. Today we
      pay with zeroes and ones &#151;digital entries on credit and debit cards, or electronic
      messages sent over the Internet. In &lt;I&gt;Moving Money&lt;/I&gt;, distinguished analysts
      explore this trend, its development and likely future, and the ramifications of this
      transformation. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a book about money as a medium of exchange &#151;in
      the past, in the present, but particularly in the future. What forms has money taken over the
      years? Moreover, how have those means of payment changed in recent years, and how will they
      develop in the future? And what (if anything) should policymakers do to facilitate those
      changes, or at least allow them to develop and mature? Brookings economists Robert E. Litan
      and Martin Neil Baily and a distinguished group of experts dissect these issues and peer into
      the future of consumer payments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The landscape of the consumer payments
      industry will be shaped at least in part by public policies. Historically, governments have
      had monopolies on the manufacture of money. Any form of payment clearly requires trust on the
      part of both the seller and the buyer, and the government must establish and enforce laws to
      secure this relationship. More controversial is the issue of whether, and to what extent,
      government is also needed to protect the market in private sector payments
      systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why do these issues matter? The payments industry is a large and
      important sector of developed economies. In the United States, private-sector payments
      providers generate approximately $280 billion a year in revenue, while the government invests
      substantial resources into making money (minting coins and printing bills) or moving it (via
      checks and various electronic transfers). And the way we pay for things influences our
      purchases &#151;what we spend money on, how much we spend, and where we spend it. Thus the
      future of consumer payments is intertwined with the health of national
      economies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; Contributors: Martin Neil Baily (Brookings), Thomas P. Brown

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Important changes have buffeted the insurance industry over the
      past decade. The 1999 repeal of key provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act unleashed a wave of
      conglomeration in financial services, as bank holding companies acquired insurance and
      securities businesses and, to a much lesser degree, insurance companies acquired securities
      firms and banks. Rivalry within the sector has intensified: insurance companies have developed
      products that compete directly with the offerings of banks and securities firms and vice
      versa. In addition, the industry has become increasingly global.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Against
      this backdrop, pressure has been building for fundamental changes to the structure of
      insurance regulation in the United States. Despite several court challenges over the years,
      insurance continues to be regulated by the states. Many insurance companies view state
      regulation as an increasing drag on their efficiency and competitiveness and support a federal
      regulatory system. However, powerful stakeholders, including state officials, state and
      regional insurance companies, and many insurance agents, oppose federal regulation. As a
      result, proposals to establish an optional federal charter (OFC) for insurance companies and
      agents remain mired in fierce debate. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Future of Insurance Regulation in
      the United States gathers some of the country's leading experts on financial regulation to
      assess the case for an enhanced federal role in the insurance sector. They pay particular
      attention to the merits of an OFC and how it might be designed. They also consider the
      principles that should guide insurance regulatory policies, regardless of the institutional
      framework, and examine the implications of financial convergence and the internationalization
      of insurance markets for an optimal regulatory structure. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The debate over
      insurance regulation has only grown in complexity and intensity since the financial crisis
      began in the fall of 2008. This book will both inform and help to shape those critical
      discussions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors: John A. Cooke (International Financial Services

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The "quality of life" concept of quality of life is a broad one.
      It incorporates basic needs but also extends beyond them to include capabilities, the
      "livability" of the environment, and life appreciation and happiness. Latin America's
      diversity in culture and levels of development provide a laboratory for studying how quality
      of life varies with a number of objective and subjective measures. These measures range from
      income levels to job insecurity and satisfaction, to schooling attainment and satisfaction, to
      measured and self-assessed health, among others.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Paradox and
      Perception&lt;/I&gt; greatly improves our understanding of the determinants of well-being in
      Latin America based on a broad "quality of life" concept that challenges some standard
      assumptions in economics, including those about the relationship between happiness and
      income.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The authors' analysis builds upon a number of new approaches in
      economics, particularly those related to the study of happiness and finds a number of
      paradoxes as the region's respondents evaluate their well-being. These include the paradox of
      unhappy growth at the macroeconomic level, happy peasants and frustrated achievers at the
      microlevel, and surprisingly high levels of satisfaction with public services among the
      region's poorest. They also have important substantive links with several of the region's
      realities, such as high levels of income inequality, volatile macroeconomic performance, and
      low expectations of public institutions and faith in the capacity of the state to deliver.
      Identifying these perceptions, paradoxes, and their causes will contribute to the crafting of
      better public policies, as well as to our understanding of why "populist" politics still
      pervade in much of the region.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;There is little dispute that the mortgage meltdown of 2007,
      created by irresponsible lending and lax oversight, helped lead to the global financial
      crisis. Why were these securities backed by subprime debt so desirable to so many seemingly
      sophisticated investors? The answer lies in distorted incentives, opaque securitization
      structures and a willingness to believe that house prices would continue to rise indefinitely
      and the hope for super-normal returns. In &lt;I&gt;Prudent Lending Restored&lt;/I&gt; experts
      from the United States, Europe, and Japan draw a timeline of key events along the road to our
      most recent recession. Providing an in-depth analysis of the causes of the subprime mortgage
      meltdown, they propose reforms, including a more simplified securitization process with
      emphasis on oversight to encourage more prudent lending. This timely volume &#151;the
      collaboration between the Brookings Institution and the Nomura Institute of Capital Markets
      Research &#151;argues that securitization can and should have a brighter future, and they lay
      out ways that will make that possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors: Jennifer E. Bethel

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The World Trade Organization &#151;backbone of today's
      international commercial relations &#151;requires member countries to
      &lt;I&gt;self-enforce&lt;/I&gt; exporters' access to foreign markets. Its dispute settlement
      system is the crown jewel of the international trading system, but its benefits still fall
      disproportionately to wealthy nations. Could the system be doing more on behalf of developing
      countries? In &lt;I&gt;Self-Enforcing Trade&lt;/I&gt;, Chad P. Bown explains why the answer is
      an emphatic "yes."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bown argues that as poor countries look to the benefits
      promised by globalization as part of their overall development strategy, they increasingly
      require access to the WTO dispute settlement process to protect their trading interests.
      Unfortunately, the practical realities of WTO dispute settlement as it currently stands create
      a number of hurdles that prevent developing countries from enjoying the trading system's full
      benefits. This book confronts these challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Self-Enforcing
      Trade&lt;/I&gt; examines the WTO's "extended litigation process," highlighting the tangle of
      international economics, law, and politics that participants must master. He identifies the
      costs that prevent developing countries from disentangling the self-enforcement process and
      fully using the WTO system as part of their growth strategies. Bown assesses recent efforts to
      help developing countries overcome those costs, including the role of the Advisory Centre on
      WTO Law and development focused NGOs. Bown's proposed Institute for Assessing WTO Commitments
      tackles the largest remaining obstacle currently limiting developing country engagement in the
      WTO's selfenforcement process &#151;a problematic lack of information, monitoring, and
      surveillance.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Fifty years after Oscar Lewis's famous depiction of five Mexican
      families caught in a "culture of poverty," Caroline Moser tells a very different story of five
      neighborhood women and their families strategically accumulating assets to escape poverty in
      the Ecuadoran city of Guayaquil. In &lt;I&gt;Ordinary Families, Extraordinary Lives&lt;/I&gt;,
      Moser shows how a more sophisticated understanding of the complexities of asset accumulation
      as well as poverty itself can help counter inaccurate stereotypes about global poverty. It
      provides invaluable insight into strategies that may help people in developing countries
      improve their wellbeing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The similar socioeconomic characteristics and
      economic circumstances of the Guayaquil families in 1978, when Moser began her research, set
      the stage for a natural experiment. By 2004, these circumstances varied widely. Moser captures
      the causes and consequences of these developments through economic data, anthropological
      narrative, and personal photos. She then places this compelling story within the broader
      context of political, economic, and spatial changes in Guayaquil and
      Ecuador.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moser describes how households in a Third World urban slum
      relentlessly and systematically fought to accumulate human, social, and financial capital
      assets. Her longitudinal account of their odyssey captures long-term trends and changes in
      perception that are missed in snapshot assessments. Chapters in this holistic story cover
      diverse issues such as housing and infrastructure, community mobilization and political
      negotiation, employment, family dynamics, violence, and emigration.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;As the global economy continues to weather the effects of the
      recession brought on by the financial crisis of 2007&#150;08, perhaps no sector has been more
      affected and more under pressure to change than the industry that was the focus of that
      crisis: financial services. But as policymakers, financial experts, lobbyists, and others seek
      to rebuild this industry, certain questions loom large. For example, should the pay of
      financial institution executives be regulated to control risk taking? That possibility
      certainly has been raised in official circles, with spirited reactions from all corners. How
      will stepped-up regulation affect key parts of the financial services industry? And what lies
      ahead for some of the key actors in both the United States and Japan?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In
      &lt;I&gt;After the Crash&lt;/I&gt;, noted economists Yasuyuki Fuchita, Richard Herring, and
      Robert Litan bring together a distinguished group of experts from academia and the private
      sector to take a hard look at how the financial industry and some of its practices are likely
      to change in the years ahead. Whether or not you agree with their conclusions, the authors of
      this volume &#151;the most recent collaboration between Brookings, the Wharton School, and the
      Nomura Institute of Capital Markets Research &#151;provide well-grounded insights that will be
      helpful to financial practitioners, analysts, and policymakers.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Today the United States has little leverage to promote
      change in Cuba. Indeed, Cuba enjoys normal relations with virtually every country in the
      world, and American attempts to isolate the Cuban government have served only to elevate its
      symbolic predicament as an "underdog" in the international arena. A new policy of engagement
      toward Cuba is long overdue&lt;/I&gt;. &#151;From the Introduction&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As
      longtime U.S. diplomats Vicki Huddleston and Carlos Pascual make painfully clear in their
      introduction, the United States is long overdue in rethinking its policy toward Cuba. This is
      a propitious time for such an undertaking &#151;the combination of change within Cuba and in
      the Cuban American community creates the most significant opening for a reassessment of U.S.
      policy since Fidel Castro took control in 1959. To that end, Huddleston and Pascual convened
      opinion leaders in the Cuban American community, leading scholars, and international diplomats
      from diverse backgrounds and political orientations to seek common ground on U.S. policy
      toward Cuba. This pithy yet authoritative analysis is the result.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the
      quest for ideas that would support the emergence of a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic
      Cuba &#151;one in which the Cuban people shape their political and economic future &#151;the
      authors conducted a series of simulations to identify the critical factors that the U.S.
      government should consider as it reformulates its Cuba policies. The advisers' wide-ranging
      expertise was applied to a series of hypothetical scenarios in which participants tested how
      different U.S. policy responses would affect a political transition in
      Cuba.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By modeling and analyzing the decisionmaking processes of the various
      strategic actors and stakeholders, the simulations identified factors that might influence the
      success or failure of specific policy options. They then projected how key actors such as the
      Cuban hierarchy, civil society, and the international and Cuban American communities might act
      and react to internal and external events that would logically be expected to occur in the
      near future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The lessons drawn from these simulations led to the unanimous
      conclusion that the United States should adopt a proactive policy of critical and constructive
      engagement toward Cuba.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Former Brookings Senior Fellow Susan E. Rice spearheads an
      investigation of the connections between poverty and fragile states and the implications for
      American security. Coedited by Rice and former Brookings colleagues Corinne Graff and Carlos
      Pascual, &lt;I&gt;Confronting Poverty&lt;/I&gt; is a timely reminder that alleviating global
      poverty and shoring up weak states are not only humanitarian and economic imperatives, but key
      components of a more balanced and sustainable U.S. national security
      strategy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rice elucidates the relationship between poverty, state weakness,
      and transnational security threats, and Graff and Pascual offer policy recommendations. The
      book's overarching conclusions highlight the need to invest in poverty alleviation and
      capacity building in weak states in order to break the vicious cycle of poverty, fragility,
      and transnational threats.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Confronting Poverty&lt;/I&gt; grows out
      of a project on global poverty and U.S. national security that Rice directed at Brookings from
      2002 through January 2009, before she became U.S. permanent representative to the United
      Nations.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;This book is based on a simple concept: no one is in a better
      position to hold a government accountable than those it governs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When
      governments fail to meet the needs of their citizens, the international community often turns
      to large external organizations such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.
      These analysts and monitors may have the resources and expertise to analyze and advise on
      public spending and governance, but where do they go when the time comes to implement new
      policies? And can they really have a more nuanced understanding of the country's problems than
      its own citizens? Who is there to watch day and night to hold the government
      accountable?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;From the Ground Up&lt;/I&gt; proposes that the
      international community's efforts to improve public expenditure and budget execution decisions
      would be more effective if done in collaboration with local independent monitoring
      organizations. Stephen Kosack, Courtney Tolmie, and Charles Griffin track the work of sixteen
      independent monitoring organizations from across the developing world, demonstrating how these
      relatively small groups of local researchers produce both thoughtful analysis and workable
      solutions. They achieve these results because their vantage point allows them to more
      effectively discern problems with governance and to communicate with their fellow citizens
      about the ideals and methods of good governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The authors also outline
      some disadvantages facing independent monitoring organizations, such as insufficient
      resources, inadequate access to data, and too little influence with high government officials.
      Collaboration with larger international organizations could help independent monitoring
      organizations overcome such obstacles, increasing their chances of improving governance
      &#151;from the ground up.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In this collaboration between the Brookings Institution and the
      Asian Development Bank Institute, eminent international economists examine the increased
      influence of Asian nations in the governance of global economic affairs, from the changing
      role of the G-20 to the reform of multilateral organizations such as the International
      Monetary Fund.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Established in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis at
      the ministerial level, the G-20 has served as a high-level platform for discussing economic
      analyses and policy responses since 1999. During the current global financial crisis, however,
      the G-20's role moved toward that of a global crisis management committee at the leadership
      level. The challenge now for the G-20 is to succeed in fostering ongoing and increasing
      cooperation among its members while being supportive of, rather than trying to replace, more
      universal institutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After analyzing the dynamics of growth in Asia
      comparatively and historically, the volume appraises the scope for policy coordination among
      key economies. The contributors analyze financial stability in emerging Asia and then assess
      the implications of Asia's increasing role within the newly emerging system of global economic
      governance, focusing especially on reform of the international monetary
      structure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors: Dony Alex (ICRIER, New Delhi), Kemal Dervis¸

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Urban and Regional Policy and Its Effects&lt;/I&gt;,
      the third in a series, sets out to inform policymakers, practitioners, and scholars about the
      effectiveness of select policy approaches, reforms, and experiments in addressing key social
      and economic problems facing cities, suburbs, and metropolitan areas. The chapters analyze
      responses to five key policy challenges that most metropolitan areas and local communities
      face:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&#149; Creating quality neighborhoods for families&lt;BR&gt; &#149;
      Governing effectively&lt;BR&gt; &#149; Building human capital&lt;BR&gt; &#149; Growing the
      middle class&lt;BR&gt; &#149; Enlarging a competitive economy through industry-based
      strategies&lt;BR&gt; &#149; Managing the spatial pattern of metropolitan growth and
      development&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each chapter discusses a specific topic under one of these
      challenges. The authors present the essence of what is known, as well as its likely
      applications, and identify the knowledge gaps that need to be filled for the successful
      formulation and implementation of urban and regional policy.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;While traditionally powerful Western economies are treading water
      at best, beset by crises in banking, housing, and employment, industrial growth and economic
      development are exploding in China and India. The world's two most populous nations are the
      biggest reasons for Asia's growing footprint on other global regions. The increasing size and
      impact of that footprint are especially important in the Middle East, an economic, religious,
      and geopolitical linchpin. &lt;I&gt;The East Moves West&lt;/I&gt; details the growing
      interdependence of the Middle East and Asia and projects the likely ramifications of this
      evolving relationship. It also examines the role of Pakistan, Japan, and South Korea in the
      region.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Geoffrey Kemp, a longtime analyst of global security and political
      economy, compares and contrasts Indian and Chinese involvement in the Middle East. He stresses
      an embedded historical dimension that gives India substantially more familiarity and interest
      in the region &#151;India was there first, and it has maintained that head start. Both
      nations, however, are clearly on the rise and leaving an indelible mark on the Middle East,
      and that enhanced influence has international ramifications for the United States and
      throughout the world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Does the emergence of these Asian giants &#151;with
      their increasingly huge need for energy &#151;strengthen the case for cooperative security,
      particularly in the maritime arena? After all, safe and open sea-lanes remain an essential
      component of mutually beneficial intercontinental trade, making India and China increasingly
      dependent on safe passage of oil tankers. Or will we see reversion to more traditional
      competition and even conflict, given that the major Asian powers themselves have so many
      unresolved problems and that the future of the U.S. presence in the area is uncertain. Kemp
      believes the United States will remain the dominant military power in the region but will have
      to share some security responsibilities with the Asians, especially in the Indian
      Ocean.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The United States is standing at a critical juncture in its
      fiscal outlook. After experiencing a brief period of budget surpluses at the turn of the
      century, the federal government will run deficits that add about $4 trillion to the national
      debt over the next decade. Substantial deficits will likely continue long into the future
      because the looming retirement of the baby boom generation will raise spending in Social
      Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. At the same time, the federal government appears to be
      neglecting spending in key areas of social and economic policy. The nation thus faces a vital
      choice: continue down a path toward future fiscal crisis while under investing in critical
      areas, or increase resources in high-priority areas while also reducing the overall budget
      deficit. This choice will materially affect Americans' economic status and security in the
      immediate future as well as over long horizons. In R &lt;I&gt;estoring Fiscal
      Sanity,&lt;/I&gt; a group of Brookings scholars with high-level government experience provide
      an overview of the country's likely medium- and long-term spending needs and the resources
      available to pay for them. They propose three alternative fiscal paths that are more
      responsible than the current path. One plan emphasizes spending cuts, the second emphasizes
      revenue increases, and a third is a balanced mix between the two.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The
      contributors address the policy choices in such areas as defense, homeland security,
      international assistance, and programs targeted to the less advantaged, the elderly, and other
      domestic priorities. In the process, they provide an understanding of the short- and long-run
      trade offs and illustrate how the budget can be reshaped to achieve high priority objectives
      in a fiscally responsible way.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Despite the recent success of welfare reform in moving people off
      public assistance and into jobs, most of America's working poor are still unable to accumulate
      even the most minimal of assets. Even when they are getting by, they lack many of the
      resources &#151;tangible and intangible &#151;that provide middle-class Americans with a sense
      of security, stability, and a stake in the future. In &lt;I&gt;Owning Up&lt;/I&gt;, Michelle
      Miller-Adams demonstrates how asset-building programs, used in combination with traditional
      income-based support, can be an effective means for helping millions of American out of
      poverty. Miller-Adams expands the traditional concept of assets to encompass a range of tools,
      experiences, resources, and support systems that are necessary if asset building is to serve
      as an effective anti-poverty strategy. She identifies four types of assets that can represent
      sources of wealth for low-income individuals and communities: economic human social, and
      natural assets. Economic assets include equity, retirement savings, and other financial
      holdings. Human assets include education, knowledge, skills, and talents. Included among
      social assets are the networks of trust and reciprocity that bind communities together.
      Natural assets include the land, water, air and other natural resources we depend on for
      survival. Owning Up also examines five organizations at the forefront of building assets for
      the poor. Their stories are told through the eyes of individuals whose lives they have helped
      transform. These organizations have all developed effective strategies for building assets,
      and Miller-Adams identifies them as models to be emulated elsewhere. The profiled
      organizations include: Neighborhoods Incorporated of Battle Creek, Michigan. Its innovative
      strategies seek to increase home ownership and promote neighborhood revitalization in poor
      communities. The Watershed Research and Training Center. This local organization strengthens
      the natural resource-based economy by retraining workers and strengthening social ties. The
      Private Industry Partnership of Wildcat Service Corporation. Based in New York City, PIP
      trains former welfare recipients in New York City for entry-level white collar jobs. Iowa's
      Institute for Social and Economic Development. This microenterprise development organization
      is one of the largest U.S. based organizations training low-income entrepreneurs. The
      Corporation for Enterprise Development. CFED, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that has
      been instrumental in showing that poor people can and will save if given the opportunities and
      incentives for doing so. They have helped put Individual Development Accounts on the national
      agenda.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The 1990s witnessed a major revolution in telecommunications
      policy in North America and Europe. The electronics revolution swept the world, and most
      countries began to realize that they could not compete in many markets without a vibrant,
      competitive telecommunications sector. As a result, the European Union, Canada, and the United
      States launched major new liberalization policies aimed at opening all telecommunications
      markets to competition. This report presents two views of the progress towards competition
      &#151;one for North America and one for Europe. The authors provide an overview of the market
      structure on both continents prior to the 1990s, discuss significant regulatory changes during
      that decade, and analyze changes in rate structures and competition that have occurred since
      liberalization. They conclude with a look at the present and future impact of the Internet and
      other new technologies on the telecommunications industry. &lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;A good deal has been done to improve the safety of Americans on
      their own soil since the attacks of September 11, 2001. Yet there have been numerous setbacks.
      The Bush administration and Congress wasted at least six months in 2002 due to partisan
      disagreement over a new budget for homeland security, and as one consequence, resources were
      slow to reach first responders across the country. Most improvements in homeland security have
      focused on "refighting the last war" &#151;improving defenses against attacks similar to those
      the country has already suffered. Not enough has been done to anticipate possible new kinds of
      terrorist actions. Policymakers have also focused too much attention on the creation of a
      department of homeland security &#151;rather than identifying and addressing the kinds of
      threats to which the country remains vulnerable. While the creation of a cabinet-level agency
      focusing on homeland security may have merit, the authors of this study argue that the
      department will not, in and of itself, make Americans safer. To the contrary, the complexity
      of merging so many disparate agencies threatens to distract Congress and the administration
      from other, more urgent security efforts. This second edition of Protecting the American
      Homeland urges policymakers to focus on filling key gaps that remain in the current homeland
      security effort: identifying better protection for private infrastructure; using information
      technology to share intelligence and more effectively "connect the dots" that could hold hints
      to possible terrorist tactics; expanding the capacities of the Coast Guard and Customs
      Service, as well as airline transportation security; dealing with the possible threat of
      surface-to-air missiles to airliners; and encouraging better coordination among intelligence
      agencies. While acknowledging the impossibility of preventing every possible type of terrorist
      violence, the authors recommend a more systematic approach to homeland security that focuses
      on preventing attacks that can cause large numbers of casualties, massive economic or societal
      disruption, or severe political harm to the nation.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Foundations play an essential part in the philanthropic activity
      that defines so much of American life. No other nation provides its foundations with so much
      autonomy and freedom of action as does the United States. Liberated both from the daily
      discipline of the market and from direct control by government, American foundations
      understandably attract great attention. As David Hammack and Helmut Anheier note in this
      volume, "Americans have criticized foundations for... their alleged conservatism, liberalism,
      elitism, radicalism, devotion to religious tradition, hostility to religion &#151;in short,
      for commitments to causes whose significance can be measured, in part, by the controversies
      they provoke. Americans have also criticized foundations for ineffectiveness and even
      foolishness."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Their size alone conveys some sense of the significance of
      American foundations, whose assets amounted to over $530 billion in 2008 despite a dramatic
      decline of almost 22 percent in the previous year. And in 2008 foundation grants totaled over
      $45 billion. But what roles have foundations actually played over time, and what distinctive
      roles do they fill today? How have they shaped American society, how much difference do they
      make? What roles are foundations likely to play in the future?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This
      comprehensive volume, the product of a three-year project supported by the Aspen Institute's
      program on the Nonprofit Sector and Philanthropy, provides the most thorough effort ever to
      assess the impact and significance of the nation's large foundations. In it, leading
      researchers explore how foundations have shaped &#151;or failed to shape &#151;each of the key
      fields of foundation work. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;American Foundations&lt;/I&gt; takes
      the reader on a wide-ranging tour, evaluating foundation efforts in education, scientific and
      medical research, health care, social welfare, international relations, arts and culture,
      religion, and social change.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Approaching an uncertain future without Fidel Castro, and still
      reeling from a downturn at the end of the cold war, Cuba must act decisively to improve its
      economy and living conditions. One of the major challenges facing the impoverished island
      nation is securing access to energy resources that are sufficient to meet the needs of its
      revitalization and development goals. What steps can Cuba take to achieve both short- and
      long-term energy sustainability and self-sufficiency? In this timely analysis, Jonathan
      Benjamin-Alvarado and his colleagues answer that question.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;Cuba's
      Energy Future&lt;/I&gt; sets the geostrategic context within which Cuba is operating. The book
      provides an overview of the evolving relations among Caribbean states and explains why Cuba
      and its longtime nemesis the United States should look for ways to cooperate on developing
      energy resources. The possible role of oil companies is explored, as is Cuba's energy
      relationship with Hugo Chavez's Venezuela.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second section of
      &lt;I&gt;Cuba's Energy Future&lt;/I&gt; features economic and technical appraisals, economic
      projections, and trends affecting Cuba's energy needs, including oil and natural gas
      potential, the country's antiquated electric power sector, and the role of biofuels such as
      sugarcane ethanol. The concluding section focuses on the conditions necessary for, and the
      mutual benefits of, greater cooperative engagement with the United
      States.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors: Juan A. B. Belt (Chemonics International, formerly

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The European Union is the most successful supranational
      organization in history. It has reconciled former enemies, established a single market and a
      common currency, and reintegrated Central and Eastern Europe into the West. Yet the EU remains
      unsatisfying to its members and its partners. An economic giant but a political pygmy, it
      seems hamstrung by bureaucracy and a lack of connection to European
      publics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Europe 2030&lt;/I&gt;, distinguished authors predict
      what the European Union will look like twenty years from new. A range of views is presented,
      foreseeing everything from slower growth and diminished power to actions that would make the
      EU a more vigorous, influential world play.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors include Oksana

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Last Exit&lt;/I&gt; Clifford Winston reminds us that
      transportation services and infrastructure in the United States were originally introduced by
      private firms. The case for subsequent public ownership and management of the system was weak,
      in his view, and here he assesses the case for privatization and deregulation to greatly
      improve Americans' satisfaction with their transportation systems.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The rapid pace and grand scale of China's rise have produced a
      heady mixture of wonder and consternation in the West. Is China on track to become a
      superpower? What would that mean for the rest of the world? Economist Hu Angang approaches
      these questions through analysis of three major dimensions of China's rise: its overall
      economic and social development; advances in education, science, and technology (including
      alternative energy); and the likely complications posed by resource scarcity, environmental
      degradation, and climate change. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After three decades of unprecedented
      economic growth, China is now home to the world's second-largest economy. It is the world's
      largest exporter and its second-largest consumer of energy (as well as number one in carbon
      emissions). Extrapolating from these seismic changes, Hu forecasts that by 2020 China will
      become a "mature, responsible, and attractive superpower" that will contribute, alongside the
      European Union, to the "end of the unipolar era dominated by the United States."
      &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;China in 2020&lt;/I&gt; presents a native Chinese perspective on
      the challenges and opportunities that Beijing will face as its global footprint expands.
      Through a meticulous examination of China's development trajectory, Hu Angang explains how his
      nation &#151;as the world's largest emerging market &#151;will impact global economic growth,
      foreign direct investment flows, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions. He proposes
      a comprehensive strategic framework to guide the next stage of China's rise, seeking to
      maximize the country's positive impact on the world and minimize the negative externalities of
      its meteoric development.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;We live in a new reality of aid. Gone is the traditional
      bilateral relationship, the old-fashioned mode of delivering aid, and the perception of the
      third world as a homogenous block of poor countries in the south. &lt;I&gt;Delivering Aid
      Differently&lt;/I&gt; describes the new realities of a $200 billion aid industry that has
      overtaken this traditional model of development assistance. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As the title
      suggests, aid must now be delivered differently. Here, case study authors consider the results
      of aid in their own countries, highlighting field-based lessons on how aid works on the
      ground, while focusing on problems in current aid delivery and on promising approaches to
      resolving these problems. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors include Cut Dian Agustina (World

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;"Our current stalemate over detention serves nobody &#151;not the
      military or any other component of the U.S. government that has to operate overseas.... It is
      a system that no rational combination of values or strategic considerations would have
      produced; it could have emerged only as a consequence of a clash of interests that produced a
      clear victory for nobody." &#151;from the Introduction&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Benjamin Wittes
      issues a persuasive call for greater coherence, clarity, and public candor from the American
      government regarding its detention policy and practices, and greater citizen awareness of the
      same. In &lt;I&gt;Detention and Denial&lt;/I&gt;, he illustrates how U.S. detention policy is
      a tangle of obfuscation rather than a serious set of moral and legal decisions. Far from
      sharpening focus and defining clear parameters for action, it sends mixed signals, muddies the
      legal and military waters, and produces perverse incentives. Its random operation makes a
      mockery of the human rights concerns that prompted the limited amount of legal scrutiny that
      detention has received to date. The government may actually be painting itself into a corner,
      leaving itself unable to explain or justify actions it may need to take in the future. The
      situation is unsustainable and must be addressed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Preventive detention is a
      touchy subject, an easy target for eager-to-please candidates and indignant media, so public
      officials remain largely mum on the issue. Many Americans would be surprised to learn that no
      broad principle in American jurisprudence actually prohibits preventive detention; rather, the
      law "eschews it except when legislatures and courts deem it necessary to prevent grave public
      harm." But the habeas corpus legal cases that have come out of the Guantánamo Bay
      detentionfacility &#151;which remains open, despite popular expectations to the contrary
      &#151;have addressed only a small slice of the overall issue and have not &#151;and will not
      &#151;produce a coherent body of policy. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;U.S. government and security
      forces need clear and consistent application of their detention policies, and Americans must
      be better informed about them. To that end, Wittes critiques America's current muddled
      detention policies and sets forth a detention policy based on candor. It would set clear rules
      and distinguish several types of detention, based on characteristics of the detainees
      themselves rather than where they were captured. Congress would follow steps to "devise a
      coherent policy to regulate the U.S. system of detention, a system that the country cannot
      avoid developing."&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;"Bill Coleman's story is one that younger generations should mark
      and inwardly digest, lest they forget the pioneers who helped to make a better America
      possible." &#151;From the Foreword by Stephen G. Breyer&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;William Coleman has
      spent a lifetime opening doors and breaking down barriers. He has been an eyewitness to
      history; moreover, he has made history. This is his inspiring story, in his own
      words.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Americans of color faced daunting barriers in the 1940s. Despite
      graduating first in his class at Harvard Law and clerking for Supreme Court Justice Felix
      Frankfurter, Coleman was shut out of major East Coast law firms. But as the Philadelphia
      native writes, "The times, they were a'changing." He not only benefited from that change
      &#151;he helped propel it, by way of dogged determination, undeniable intellect, and stellar
      accomplishment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Coleman's legal work with Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP
      Legal Defense and Educational Fund helped jumpstart the civil rights movement in the 1950s. He
      was the first American of color to clerk for the Supreme Court, and later served as senior
      counsel to the Warren Commission, investigating the assassination of President John F.
      Kennedy. In 1975 he was appointed secretary of transportation by President Gerald Ford
      &#151;the first American of color to serve in a Republican cabinet &#151;and in 1995 he
      received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Bill Clinton.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At his core,
      Bill Coleman is a lawyer. He strives to be a "counsel for the situation" &#151;an advocate
      able to take on major matters in a variety of legal disciplines while upholding the highest
      traditions of justice and the public interest. He is fiercely proud of the legal profession's
      role in a democratic society and free economy, and he is grateful for the opportunities that
      profession has afforded him in the court room, the board room, and the corridors of power. It
      is through this prism that he relates his own story &#151;his life and the
      law.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The results speak for themselves, and in this immensely entertaining
      chronicle, the Counsel for the Situation speaks for himself.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The economic downturn that began in 2008, the most severe in
      decades, has hit older Americans hard. Many have seen huge losses to their 401(k)s. In
      numerous cases the value of homes &#151;the largest investment most older Americans have ever
      made &#151;has diminished considerably. In addition, large numbers of American workers,
      including those 50 and older, have lost their jobs and may have difficulty replacing them.
      Suddenly the future seems a whole lot less certain, throwing years of planning into doubt. In
      &lt;I&gt;Reconsidering Retirement&lt;/I&gt;, economists Courtney Coile and Phillip Levine go
      beyond the headlines to explain how the economic crisis will affect the future plans and
      well-being of older Americans.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Amid well-publicized reports that older
      workers needed to stay on the job because of the crisis, the number of U.S. workers claiming
      Social Security retirement benefits actually rose substantially from 2008 to 2009. The authors
      maintain that job loss has been the culprit, leading to premature retirement, and while this
      trend may have been less noticed, it is perhaps the more significant outcome of the
      crisis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Coile and Levine examine the three major characteristics of the
      recession thought to influence retirement behavior: decline in the stock market, reduced
      housing values, and a weak labor market. The authors find that lower home prices did not
      actually affect retirement behavior but that the decline in the stock market did lead some
      workers to delay retirement, while a weakened labor market actually forced more older workers
      with fewer skills into retirement. As a result, these early retirees, who rely on Social
      Security, face a lifetime of lower benefits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"Workers affected by weak labor
      markets are more numerous than those affected by poor stock market returns, are more likely to
      have low socioeconomic status, and have a more substantially reduced income for the rest of
      their lives."&lt;BR&gt; &#151;From the introduction&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"Public discussion has
      focused on the effects of the stock market crash and has failed to recognize that most of the
      workers who are affected by stock losses come from the upper tail of the income distribution.
      Similarly, falling house prices have received considerable attention although they have had
      little impact on workers' retirement decisions. The most pressing problem older workers
      currently face is the labor market, which has received little attention."&lt;BR&gt; &#151;From
      chapter 8&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The legacy of recessions is that those most in need usually are
      last to reap the benefits of an economic recovery. While the lion's share of media coverage
      after the economic downturn of 2008&#150;09 has gone to the plight of older workers who remain
      employed, Courtney Coile and Phillip Levine examine the effects of the economic crisis on all
      workers approaching retirement age. Some of their findings are counterintuitive and will
      surprise many analysts and readers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In particular, they shine a light on
      lesser-skilled workers forced into early retirement &#151;a number estimated at 378,000
      workers. These workers will be forced into early involuntary retirement, drawing from Social
      Security sooner and receiving lower retirement income.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This important book
      provides a complete picture of older workers today, how they will transition into retirement,
      and what we can do to assist them as the recession persists.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Traditional public finance provides a powerful framework for
      policy analysis, but it relies on a model of human behavior that the new science of behavioral
      economics increasingly calls into question. In &lt;I&gt;Policy and Choice&lt;/I&gt; economists
      William Congdon, Jeffrey Kling, and Sendhil Mullainathan argue that public finance not only
      can incorporate many lessons of behavioral economics but also can serve as a solid foundation
      from which to apply insights from psychology to questions of economic
      policy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The authors revisit the core questions of public finance, armed with
      a richer perspective on human behavior. They do not merely apply findings from psychology to
      specific economic problems; instead, they explore how psychological factors actually reshape
      core concepts in public finance such as moral hazard, deadweight loss, and
      incentives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Part one sets the stage for integrating behavioral economics
      into public finance by interpreting the evidence from psychology and developing a framework
      for applying it to questions in public finance. In part two, the authors apply that framework
      to specific topics in public finance, including social insurance, externalities and public
      goods, income support and redistribution, and taxation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In doing so, the
      authors build a unified analytical approach that encompasses both traditional policy levers,
      such as taxes and subsidies, and more psychologically informed instruments. The net result of
      this innovative approach is a fully behavioral public finance, an integration of psychology
      and the economics of the public sector that is explicit, systematic, rigorous, and
      realistic.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Burma had the brightest prospects of any Southeast Asian nation
      after World War II. In the years since, however, it has dropped to the bottom of the world's
      socioeconomic ladder. The grossly misruled nation &#151;officially known as Myanmar &#151;is
      in the midst of a political transition based on a new constitution and its first multiparty
      elections in twenty years. That transition, together with a recent change in U.S. policy,
      prompted this book.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Two military dictators have ruled Myanmar with an iron
      fist for nearly fifty years. A popular uprising in 1988 was brutally suppressed, but it forced
      the generals to hold an election in 1990. When an anti-regime party led by Nobel Peace Prize
      Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi won by a landside, however, the generals rejected the results, put
      Suu Kyi under house arrest for most of two decades, and continued to exploit the country's
      abundant resources for their own benefit while depriving citizens of basic services. Years of
      Western sanctions had no measurable impact, but in 2009 the Obama administration adopted a new
      policy of "pragmatic engagement," encouraging greater respect of democratic principles and
      human rights as a basis for eventual removal of sanctions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This thoughtful
      volume examines Burma today primarily through the eyes of its ASEAN partners, its superpower
      neighbors China and India, and its own people. It provides insights into the overarching
      problem of national reconciliation, the strategic competition between China and India, the
      role of ASEAN, and the underperforming, resource-cursed
      economy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Contributors include Pavin Chachavalpongpun (Institute of Southeast

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;In 2007 two former U.S. secretaries of state, a defense
      secretary, and a former senator wrote persuasively in the &lt;I&gt;Wall Street
      Journal&lt;/I&gt; that the time had come to move seriously toward a nuclear-free world. Almost
      two years later, the Global Zero movement was born with its chief aim to rid the world of such
      weapons once and for all by 2030.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But is it realistic or even wise to
      envision a world without nuclear weapons? More and more people seem to think so. Barack Obama
      has declared "America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear
      weapons." But that is easier said than done. Michael O'Hanlon places his own indelible stamp
      on this critical issue, putting forth a "friendly skeptic's case for nuclear
      disarmament."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Calls to "ban the bomb" are as old as the bomb itself, but the
      pace and organization of nonproliferation campaigns have picked up greatly recently. The
      growing Global Zero movement, for example, wants treaty negotiations to begin in 2019. Would
      this be prudent or even feasible in a world that remains dangerous, divided, and
      unpredictable? After all, America's nuclear arsenal has been its military trump card for much
      of the period since World War II. Pursuing a nuclear weapons ban prematurely or carelessly
      could alarm allies, leading them to consider building their own weapons &#151;the opposite of
      the intended effect.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;O'Hanlon clearly presents the dangers of nuclear
      weapons and the advantages of disarmament as a goal. But even once an accord is in place, he
      notes, temporary suspension of restrictions may be necessary in response to urgent threats
      such as nuclear "cheating" or discovery of an advanced biological weapons program. To take all
      nuclear options off the table forever strengthens the hand of those that either do not make
      that pledge or do not honor it. For the near term, traditional approaches to arms control,
      including dismantling existing bomb inventories, can pave the way to make a true
      nonproliferation regime possible in the decades ahead.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;Brazil has undergone transformative change since the 1980s, from
      an authoritarian regime to a democratic society advancing on all fronts &#151;political,
      social, economic, and diplomatic. In &lt;I&gt;Starting Over&lt;/I&gt;, Albert Fishlow traces
      the evolution of this member of the BRICS group over the last twenty-five years and looks
      toward the future as the newly elected president, Dilma Rousseff, follows her very popular
      predecessor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, or "Lula."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The transformation of the
      country began with the founding of the Nova República and the Constitution of 1988, which
      established a strong executive and encased key social principles such as a citizen's right to
      education and health care. Then the Real Plan of 1994 &#151;initiated under President Fernando
      Henrique Cardoso &#151;set the stage for economic growth and a stable economy. There were
      setbacks, especially in the mid-1990s with the Mexican devaluation, Asian financial crisis,
      Russian default, and Argentine collapse, and, later, the U.S. recession. But changed economic
      policies in the late 1990s put Brazil on the right path to future economic growth, which
      resumed during the Lula years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With popular participation in the electoral
      process at an all-time high, politics has been profoundly altered in Brazil. Economic rules
      are now more permanent, and economic advance more regular. A healthier and longer life is now
      available to a broader swath of the population, and there is opportunity for social
      advancement. In addition, its foreign policy has greater consequence internally as well as
      externally.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dilma's two immediate predecessors &#151;Cardoso and Lula
      &#151;are tough acts to follow.Their influence has been profound, and Brazil is now a very
      different nation than it was in the 1980s. But she is working from their template to move the
      country forward. This insightful book clearly explains how and why the country has progressed
      to its current standing and what the future portends. &lt;I&gt;Starting Over&lt;/I&gt; is
      essential reading for anyone trying to grasp what is happening in this dynamic
      nation.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt; &lt;I&gt;The Brown Center Report on American Education&lt;/I&gt;
      provides an accurate, nonpartisan, data-driven account of American elementary and secondary
      education. Its purpose is four-fold: to determine the direction of achievement in U.S. public
      schools; to gauge the significance of changes; to uncover the policies and practices
      influencing the direction of student achievement; and finally, to figure out whether the
      public is getting the full story on student learning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This year's report
      tackles perennial questions of how to interpret trends in test scores, the distribution of
      achievement, school turnarounds, and charter schools. It examines national test data going
      back to 1971 from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, compares the 1989 and 2009
      test scores of more than 1,000 schools, and compares the test scores of conversion charter
      schools from 1986 to those from 2008.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;An overarching theme of this year's report is that events in the
      field of education are not always as they appear to be &#151;and that is especially so with
      test scores. Whether it's commentators perpetrating myths of international testing, states
      winning races while evidencing only mediocre progress, or an eighth-grade test dominated by
      content below the eighth grade, the story is rarely as simple as it appears on first blush.
      This report digs beneath the surface and uncovers some of the complexities of these important
      issues.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>

    <PublisherDescription>&lt;P&gt;The United States is in the midst of historic experiments with
      publicly funded choice in K-12 education, experiments that recently received a "green light"
      from the Supreme Court. Other nations have long experience with the funding and regulation of
      nonpublic schools, including religious schools. This book asks what U.S. policymakers, public
      officials, and citizens can learn from these experiences. In particular, how do other
      countries regulate or structure publicly funded educational choice with an eye toward civic
      values &#151;looking not only for improvements in test scores, but also in tolerance, civic
      cohesion, and democratic values such as integration across the lines of class, religion, and
      race?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The experience of Europe and Canada with school choice is both
      extensive and varied. In England and Wales, public school choice is widespread, as parents
      play a significant role in selecting the school their children will attend. In the Netherlands
      and much of Belgium, a majority of students attend religious schools at government expense. In
      Canada, France, and Germany, state-financed school choice is limited to circumstances that
      serve particular social and governmental needs. In Italy, school choice has just recently
      arrived on the policy agenda. In spite of the diversity of national experiences, in all of
      these countries choice is regulated by the government in significant and varied ways to
      promote civic values. In several of these countries, school choice policy itself appears to
      have played an important role in promoting social cohesion and integration. This book presents
      a wealth of experience designed to aid policymakers and citizens as they consider historic
      changes in American public education policy.&lt;/P&gt; </PublisherDescription>
