# Creation record for the identifier generator in NOID/noid.bdb.

who:       cmjp/cmsys
what:      unlimited sequential identifiers of form cts.zeeek
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind
       and mint an unbounded number of identifiers
       with the template "cts.zeeek".
       Sample identifiers would be "22573/cts000m" and "22573/cts2gw28".
       Minting order is sequential.
when:      20101119155000
where:     aa2cmjpora02.ithaka.org:/cmjp/noid/cts/.
Version:   Noid 0.423
Size:      unlimited
Template:  cts.zeeek
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_cts4+".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:G--NITE)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "G--NITE", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
